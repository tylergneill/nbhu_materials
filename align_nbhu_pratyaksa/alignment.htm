  <td class=xl65 width=856 style='border-top:none;border-left:none;width:642pt'>Mangala
  as a means of completion of the work: Commenting on the mangala verse of the
  Nyayasara, Bhasarvajna says in the Nyayabhusana that <font class="font5">the
  sentence, &quot;Having bowed down to Śambhu...&quot; etc. is meant for an
  auspicious commencement of the treatise as well as for the knowledge of
  Relation, Purpose and Subject-matter of the same.</font><font class="font0">
  The nature of Relation etc. will be clarified in due course. While showing
  the importance of mangala, Bhasarvajna says that indeed </font><font
  class="font5">the major obstacles resulting from demerits of an author could
  successfully be removed by the performance of mangala accompanied by an
  obeisance. It wards off the potential influence of demerits and consequently
  helps to bring a treatise to completion. Thus a mangala performed along with
  obeisance serves a special purpose and so it is meaningful. But where a work
  is found to have remained incomplete, it could be presumed that either the
  mangala must not have been appropriately performed by the author or he must
  have committed so many misdeeds that they could not all be removed by
  mangala. The fact that a work is found incomplete in spite of its having a
  mangala verse in the beginning does by no means prove that the mangala is
  always in&lt;p.55&gt;capable of removing obstacles, since it is seen to have
  been capable in this respect elsewhere. Though a hundred pots, full of water,
  may prove incapable of putting out the fire in a stable set ablaze, yet they
  are not found to be incapable of extinguishing (even a small fire) elsewhere
  also. On the other hand where a work is found to have been completed even
  without there being the performance of mangala, it could be inferred that the
  author must have performed mangala either mentally, or physically (before he
  began writing his work). Or the author must have accumulated merits by some
  means other than mangala.</font></td>

  since further progress in this activity needs much endeavour on the part of a
  reader, an intelligent person would expect a clear statement regarding the
  purpose etc. at the commencement of a work. Further, what is needed to
  motivate person desirous of achieving the highest good (i.e. emancipation) is
  not just the statement of relation etc., but also the statement of the
  purpose that is meant and that of the subject-matter known as means etc. of
  achieving the purpose. In addition, the relation of the treatise with purpose
  (i.e. Sādhyasādhanabhāva) and with the subject-matter of the same (i.e.
  Visayavisayibhava) as well as the relation of the treatise with teacher and
  with pupil should categorically be stated in the beginning of a work.
  Accordingly, the first Nyayasutra stating the purpose and the subject-matter
  or contents of the Nyaya runs as follows: A man can attain emancipation
  &lt;p.58&gt; through the true knowledge of pramana etc. Here emancipation is
  pointed out as the purpose, while pramanas etc. are pointed out as
  constituting the contents of the Nyaya. In this sutra the relation of the
  treatise (i.e. Nyayasastra) with the teacher and the taught is not stated
  since it is logically implied therein. However, the fact that the author of
  the Nyaya-sutra has not mentioned this relation does by no means indicate
  that a commentator of the Nyaya-Sutra also could ignore it. He should clearly
  state the mutual relation as this - &quot;This treatise is related to the
  purpose and like: such a teacher is competent to teach this treatise. I am
  also an eligible pupil to study this treatise.&quot; Thus construing the
  relation a man would proceed to read the work. Thus, in Bhasarvajna's view,
  an author should necessarily state the four requisite items, namely, purpose,
  subject-matter, entitled teacher and pupil and their relation with the
  treatise (anubandha-catustaya) in the beginning of his work.</td>

  since the principal purpose, i.e, emancipation, is certainly understood as
  implied in the mangala verse in the statement of the immediate and secondary
  purpose, viz. instruction or enlightenment. It is quite certain that instruction
  or enlightening is meant for emancipation. It will be discussed in what
  follows as to how the instruction could be a means of emancipation. Or it is
  ascertained on the basis of the study of Veda, Sutra, that the true knowledge
  is the cause of emancipation. Therefore the inquiry now is in respect of the
  cause of true knowledge, and keeping this in view the author has stated the
  subsidiary purpose.</font></td>

  answer to this is that this contention is not tenable. In a tatpurusa
  compound even the initial term is sometimes found to be principal. As for
  example, in the statement, &quot;a century of students is fed (Chatra-satam
  bhojitam)&quot;<font class="font0">, the term 'chatra-satam' is a tatpurusa
  compound, but here the initial word 'chatra' is principal and the final word
  'satam' is sub-ordinate, because the dining or feeding is related to students
  and not to the number hundred. &lt;p.61&gt; Thus in the compound
  'pramana....laksanam' the initial word pramana may be taken as principal.</font><font
  class="font5"> Or </font><font class="font0">the ending word in the compound,
  i.e. *laksana* may be taken as principal in deference to the grammatical
  rule.</font><font class="font5"> Accordingly the author of the Nyaya-sutra
  has first shown tattva (i.e . the real nature) as separate from pramana etc.
  by using the śeṣe ṣaṣṭhī such as 'pramanadinam Tattvam' (the true nature in
  respect of pramana etc.); and then he has said that emancipation could be
  attained through the true knowledge in respect of pramana etc. </font><font
  class="font0">Here it is very clearly pointed out that the direct means of
  obtaining emancipation is the knowledge regarding the true nature of pramana
  etc</font><font class="font5">. And what is meant by true nature of pramana
  etc. is just their definition. </font><font class="font0">In order to know
  the true nature of pramana etc. one has to define them, so that the true
  nature of pramana etc. could be precisely understood. Thus the word 'tattva'
  in the Nyayasutra signifies the definitions of pramana etc. Hence the
  compound in the Nyayasara (pramana...laksanam) is supported by the

  its own certain knowledge helps to ascertain the nature of the object by not
  allowing it to be confused with others and singles out the particular object
  is the defining characteristic (or the definition) of the object. And when
  the definition (defining characteristic) is not determined, the definable

  over the Purpose behind stating Definitions: Now Bhasarvajna tries to
  establish that it is really necessary to frame definitions of pramana etc.
  and then he proceeds to discuss and ascertain them properly, as this helps to
  dispel the misconceived ideas regarding the true nature of things. In this
  context Bhasarvajna, quotes a verse from the Nyayavatara of Siddhasena
  Divakara, a well-known Jaina philosopher. The verse is given in the
  Nyayavatara as containing a prima-facie view. This verse says that <font
  class="font5">pramanas and the practice or behaviour on their basis are
  well-known to the people. Therefore, no purpose is served by stating
  definitions of pramanas etc.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">The same could be said of the exposition of prameya etc. also.
  What is meant by this contention is that it is quite obvious that a
  definition cannot bring about the object which is to be defined. As for
  example a cow itself and the &lt;p.63&gt; characteristics defining the cow,
  such as, hoofs, dew-lap etc. are simultaneously seen.</font><font
  class="font0"> The distinctive characteristics, dew-lap etc. cannot be
  admitted as bringing about the cow - for a cause should be prior to an
  effect. </font><font class="font5">Moreover, </font><font class="font0">some
  of the definables</font><font class="font5"> like Atman etc.</font><font
  class="font0"> can never be believed to have been produced by their
  respective distinctive characteristics, </font><font class="font5">because
  such definables are eternal.</font><font class="font0"> Thus it is clear that
  the defining or distinctive characteristics are not productive causes of the
  definables.</font><font class="font5"> Nor can the laksana, i.e. defining
  characteristic be regarded as a cognitive cause, one that enables us to know
  the definable. It is found in the world that even when definitions are not
  known to the people, they fully know the definables.</font><font class="font0">
  Thus it is apparent that the defining or distinctive characteristics could
  become neither a productive cause nor a cognitive one in respect of
  definables. </font><font class="font5">Further</font><font class="font0">,
  the formulation of definitions (distinctive characteristics) </font><font
  class="font5">would certainly involve the logical fault of infinite series,
  and it could not be avoided.</font><font class="font0"> The exposition of an
  object would depend upon its definition, again the explanation of that
  definition which itself would be a definable, would depend upon another
  definition. And that would again require another definition. In this way the
  process of framing definitions would be endless. This is the fault of
  infinite series.</font></td>

  Rejoinder: Bhasarvajna rejoins that it has been argued by the opponent that
  the defining characteristic is neither a productive cause nor a cognitive
  cause of the object to be defined. Here it may be clarified that the Nyaya
  thinkers also do not accept the view that a definition furnishes a productive
  cause for the definable. Thus, <font class="font5">the non-acceptance or
  rejection of the first alternative, a defining characteristic is a productive
  cause of definable, is itself a rejoinder to the first contention.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">However, as regards the second
  contention (i.e. a defining characteristic is not even a cognitive cause of
  definable), it could be asserted that we certainly get the knowledge of a cow
  or the like through its definition</font><font class="font0">. Nobody would
  deny that a defining characteristic helps us in knowing the thing in
  question. As for example, </font><font class="font5">a man, who knows some
  uncommon characteristic</font><font class="font0"> such as a white mark on
  the forehead of the cow, </font><font class="font5">could easily recognise
  and determine his own cow from among a herd of cows.</font><font class="font0">
  </font><font class="font5">But on the other hand, a man who does not know</font><font

  class="font5">This is true of all the particulars of the species of things,

  class="font5">In answer to this, Bhasarvajna says that the contention cannot
  be upheld. For, an over-pervasive or inadequate pervasive character also can
  serve as a distinguishing factor</font><font class="font0"> when it can
  distinguish a thing from others. </font><font class="font5">For instance,
  when the characteristic of being horned can distinguish a cow from others, it
  should be accepted as a definition of cow. Similarly, when an inadequate
  pervasive characteristic can mark an object as distinct from others, is also
  should be recognised as a definition. As for example, the characteristic of
  being endowed with motion can serve as the definition of substance (dravya).
  It is not that the characteristic of being endowed with motion that we find
  in a thing does not determine the thing as substance.</font><font
  class="font0"> It certainly does so. And it is quite obvious that whatever
  can be a substratum of motion is exclusively a substance alone. Nothing else
  than a substance can be a substratum of motion. On this basis we can say that
  whatever is endowed with motion is always a substance.</font><font
  class="font5"> </font><font class="font0">However,</font><font class="font5">
  the fault of inadequate pervasiveness would arise, if we say that only that
  object which is endowed with motion is substance.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">For</font><font class="font0">, this means that what is devoid
  of motion is not a substance. </font><font class="font5">This would give rise
  to the contingency of ākāśa being non-dravya.</font><font class="font0"> The
  above definition<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&lt;p.68&gt; of
  substance is faulty, because is cannot cover the whole range of substance
  which is here definable. For, ākāśa, though being admitted as dravya would
  not be covered by the above definition, since it is devoid of motion. </font><font
  class="font5">But, on the other hand, if we intend to say that whatever is
  endowed with motion is necessarily a substance, then the definition would be
  faultless,</font><font class="font0"> as no motion could ever come into
  existence without having a substance as its substratum. Bhasarvajna has thus
  established that a characteristic, whether inadequate pervasive or
  over-pervasive can serve as a defining characterstic. </font><font

  the general definition that a substance having desire etc. is an Atman could

  case of such a emancipated soul, the usage of calling it Atman could be
  established by another characteristic (atmatva). Similarly, though Akasa etc.
  are not endowed with activity, they are called substance on account of their
  state &lt;p.69&gt; of being endowed with qualities like sabda etc. In the
  same manner, even an emancipated soul is called Atman, since it is endowed
  with soulness though it is devoid of qualities like desire etc. Likewise,
  despite the absence of common distinctive characteristic of not allowing two
  cognitions to take place simultaneously, the internal organ (Antahkarana)
  deserted by the emancipated soul, called Manas, on account of its having
  'Mindness.' Similarly though a body buried under stones cannot be the
  substratum of actions or movements, it is called body, because it has
  bodyness and it is the abode of sense-organs. In determining a palm no
  consideration for and against is required, still the definite knowledge about
  palm is called 'nirnaya'. This applies to other definitions also.</td>

  class="font0"> By negating all other things it distinguishes what is to be

  dew-lap etc. negates all objects that are non-cows and thus distinguishes a
  particular animal, i.e. a cow, from others. It may be noted here that the
  word 'eke' in the Nyayabhusana is taken to mean ‘Purvacaryah' by Apararkadeva
  in the Nyayamuktavali, a commentary on the Nyayasara of Bhasarvajna.
  Vacaspati seems to be later than Bhasarvajna, the latter could not be referring

  class="font5">However in Bhasarvajna's view as said above, terms like visesa

    The reply to this is that this contention is not justified. For, the
  treatise describing definitions is meant for removing illusion by repeating
  or by making an explanatory reference to something known to the people.
  Deluded persons who are dogmatically obsessed with the philosophical systems
  other than the Nyaya state the definition or distinguishing characteristic of
  pramana etc. in diverse ways. Consequently ordinary people also are confused
  and they also start differing. Such confusions are removed by making an
  explanatory reference to the definitions or distinguishing characteristics
  which are already known to the people; just as the embarrassment of a child
  deluded in recognising his own father can be dispelled by making a reference
  to some particular characteristic of his father which is already known to the
  child, persons deluded by other philosophical systems, seek to establish true
  pramanas having Atman etc. as their objects, as false pramanas or as
  semblances of pramanas (pramanabhasa) and to establish Arthapatti
  (Implication) etc that are not distinct entities, as independent ones. When
  such confusions are created in respect of pramana etc., it is positively
  stated that whatever serves as a means of true knowledge should be regarded
  as pramana. On the other hand, when the semblances of pramanas
  (pramanabhasa), having non-dualism, momentariness, eternality<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&lt;p.74&gt; of vedas, non-existence of
  Atman, etc. as their objects, are sought to be established as true pramanas
  like perception etc., and when the pramanas which are in fact independent
  ones are sought to be established as non-different from others, it is
  negatively asserted (or prohibited) that whatever does not have such and such
  characteristics cannot be regarded as a pramana. Thus a motive behind
  explanatory reference (anuvada) can be detected in the case of the
  definitions of soul etc., and in the case of the definitions of doubt etc.
  This also dismisses the doubt that it is already known from the Upanisads and
  other sastras such as Yoga-sastra, that the true knowledge of Atman is a
  means to the attainment of emancipation, so this śāstra laying down this is
  meaningless. Indeed, the knowledge of Atman, emancipation etc. is not laid
  down afresh in the Nyaya-sastra. This is well-known, so referring to what is
  known, the Nyaya-sastra only shows afresh how the knowledge of atman etc. can
  be held to be tenable by means of pramana and this it does by logically
  affirming the existence of soul, etc. and refuting all contradictory
  positions. It does this in order to dispel the illusion of those who are
  misled by the philosophical systems of the Buddhists and others, and
  therefore, falsely regard the knowledge of soul, etc. as the cause of mundane
  existence, and regard emancipation while the soul persists to exist as a
  non-reality. It would thus be possible to come to the conclusion that all
  that is stated in the Upanisads etc. is true only and a man with true insight
  becoming free from doubt can resort to the means of emancipation, known to
  him from the Upanisads, etc. and attain, emancipation.</td>

    Thus we see that in his introductory remarks in the NyayabhUsana
  Bhasarvajna has shown the importance of mangala and of the mention of the
  anubandha- catustaya, as without knowing these, no reader would take up the
  work for study. The practices of performing mangala in the form of an
  obeisance to one's own deity was prevalent from early time and it was
  followed by the wise for the completion of their works without hindrance. As
  Annam Bhatta points out, the existence of a sruti enjoining mangala can be
  inferred from the accepted practice of mangala that was followed by the
  learned. We find that Prasastapada, the earliest known commentator on the
  Vaisesika-sutra, pays homage to the Lord, who is the cause of all that
  originates and to the sage Kanada. Uddyotakara, it may be noted, has not
  written any mangala stanza, but as Vacaspati Misra explains, he must have
  performed mangala orally in the form of an obeisance to his accepted deity,
  but since this procedure was well known, he has not introduced it at the
  commencement of his work, Nyayavartika. Jayanta pays his respects to Lord
  Sambhu, Bhavani and Ganadhipati in the beginning of the Nyayamanjari.
  Bhasarvajna as we have seen bows down to Lord Sambhu or Umapati and to all
  the preceptors in the beginning of his works. Vacaspati Misra offers a prayer
  to Pinakin (Śiva) and pays homage to Aksapada at the commencement of his
  Nyayavartika. Sridhara performs obeisance<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>&lt;p.76&gt; to Lord Purusottama in the mangala verse of the
  Nyayakandali. Moreover, he remarks that the removal of obstacles can be
  effected only by means of mangala, as the wise have accepted this as a rule.
  He further says that the commentators of the Nyaya and the Mimamsa (Vatsyayana
  and Sahara) have not performed obeisance to the deity; nevertheless they must
  have certainly done it orally though they have not introduced it in their
  works. Udayana performs obeisance to Sarasvati in the beginning of his
  commentary, Parisuddhi. Thus we see that the procedure of performing mangala
  was followed as an accepted practice of the wise, by a number of writers of
  the Nyaya and the Vaisesika schools.<br>
    <br>
    As regards the four requisite items known as anubandha-catustaya, we find
  that most of the authors seek to assert and clarify in the beginning of their
  works, the purpose, the subject, the qualifications of one entitled to teach
  or to learn that work and the relation of the work with the purpose, subject
  etc. It is generally accepted that the mention of the purpose etc. is
  necessary to motivate the reader or the audience in respect of the activity
  of reading or learning the work in question. In Uddyotakara's view, the
  attainment of the highest good of man is the purpose of the Nyayasastra; a
  person entitled to study this Sastra should be one who has not come to know
  the true nature of things through perception and inference and at the same
  time one who is endowed with spiritual power. Jayanta says that in order to
  give an impetus to the reader, the author should necessarily mention the
  purpose and the subject of his work at the outset. He further remarks that
  the relation of the work with purpose etc. could then be taken as implied by
  the mention of the sub-strata of the relation, viz. the<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&lt;p.77&gt; subject etc. Following this
  tradition Bhasarvajna has, as we have seen, mentioned the purpose etc. in the
  beginning of the Nyayabhusana. It may be noted that like Bhasarvajna Jayanta,
  Vacaspati Misra, Sridhara and Udayana also have pointed out the importance of
  mentioning purpose etc. at the commencement of a work.<br>
    <br>
    It is likely that the practice of mangala must have been initiated by the
  Buddhist writers. Nagarjuna, Dinnaga, Vasubandhu, Dipakara, Dharmakirti - all
  these have performed<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&lt;p.78&gt;
  mangala in their respective works. Umasvati, the Jain author, also has
  followed this practice. So also Parthasarathi has performed mangala in his
  Sastradipika. Vyasa in his Yogabhasya also has accepted the practice of
  mangala.Vyasa50 in his '3.lso bas accepted the practice of mangala.<span

  persons can avail themselves of the Nyayasastra. It helps them in two ways:
  (A) On the strength of ratiocination they can convincingly explain to others
  what they know ; (B) they can safeguard their tenets from the opponents'
  attacks. As the author of the Nyaya-sutra says,</font><font class="font0">
  &quot;Disputation and wrangling should be carried on </font><font
  class="font5">for the purpose of defending one's own determined view
  regarding reality,</font><font class="font0"> just as the hedge of thorny
  branches is put up for the protection of sprouting seeds.&quot; </font><font
  class="font5">Thus, the aphorisms relating to enumeration and definition are
  meant to merely restate the categories as we know them, whereas the aphorisms
  pertaining to examination are regarded as purposeful as they are capable of
  bringing about the fruit of the purpose behind restating the categories.</font><font
  class="font0"> The fruit that these aphorisms pertaining to examination yield
  consists in the acceptance of certain principles and in the rejection of
  others. </font><font class="font5">This is the principal aim of the
  Nyaya-sastra.</font><font class="font0"> Thus the Nyayasastra proves to be
  useful. What is meant is this : A person might feel a doubt as to the
  existence of soul, its eternality, the nature of emancipation etc. Unless
  such doubts are cleared, no one would proceed on the path leading to the attainment
  of emancipation. That is to say, in order to employ himself in an activity
  leading to emancipation, a<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>&lt;p.82&gt; man must first have his doubts removed. The Nyayasastra
  enables a man to clear such doubts and thereby enables him to plunge in the
  activity leading to emancipation.</font></td>

  ascertainment follows the ascertainment of pramana (means of right cognition)

  of the Nyayavidya (the science of Reasoning): As said above, the science of
  Reasoning gives definitions of pramana etc. and thereby enables a man to
  attain emancipation. Not only this, but it also helps us to understand all
  the other Sastras (disciplines). Hence Bhasarvajna seeks to establish the
  excellence of the Nyayavidya over all other disciplines. Vatsyayana says in
  this regard - <font class="font5">This science of reasoning, dealing with the
  means of valid knowledge and the other categories,- is the lamp of all lores;
  the means (of the knowledge) of all things; it is the basis of all activities
  and as such it has been expounded at the very outset (of all scientific
  investigation). Here it may be considered - Is the classification of the
  various lores made on the basis of the difference in their subjects ? Or is
  it made on the basis of difference in their aims or purposes ? If the
  classification is made on the basis of different subjects, then vidya, lore
  or science should be divided into fourteen kinds and not into four (viz. the
  science of reasoning - Anviksiki, three Vedas - Trayi, the science of
  Agriculture etc. - varta, the science of government dandaniti)</font><font
  class="font0"> &lt;p.84&gt; </font><font class="font5">because each one of
  them has a different subject to discuss.</font><font class="font0"> A verse
  in the Visnupurana enumerates the </font><font class="font5">fourteen
  branches of learning as follows</font><font class="font0"> - </font><font
  class="font5">the six Angas - limbs auxiliary to Vedas</font><font
  class="font0"> - Siksa (the science of proper articulation and
  pronunciation), Kalpa (Ceremonial sutras), Vyakarana (Grammar), Nirukta (the
  science of etymological interpretation of words), Chandas ( the science of
  metres), Jyotis (astronomy); </font><font class="font5">four Vedas </font><font
  class="font0">( Rk, Yajus, Saman, Atharvan); </font><font class="font5">Mimamsa,
  Nyaya, Purana and Dharmasastra</font><font class="font0"> (the science of
  laws). </font><font class="font5">Moreover, it is also not proper to fix the
  limit at fourteen only, as we find many more sastras such as Saivasiddhanta,
  Vaidyasastra (medicine) etc. which have different subjects to discuss.</font><font
  class="font0"> Thus the first alternative, viz. the classification on the
  basis of difference in subjects, cannot be accepted. Now, if the second
  alternative, viz. the classification on the basis of difference of aim or
  purpose is admitted, then Dandaniti (the science of government) and Varta (
  the science of Agriculture etc.) would have to be regarded as non-different,
  since they both aim at the same purpose, i.e. the acquisition of wealth.
  Similarly. the Upanisads and the Anviksiki (Dialectics, the science of Reasoning)
  would come to be non-different, as both of them serve the same purpose, i.e.
  attainment of emancipation. Thus on the basis of difference of purpose we
  cannot classify vidya into four divisions, such as Trayi ( three vedas),
  Varta, Dandaniti and Anviksiki. Therefore, the classification of Vidya into
  four kinds, says, Bhasarvajna, should be regarded as based on the difference
  in the treatment of the four purusarthas (human goals), one of them being
  principal, and the others subsidiary. All have as their goal the exposition
  of one of the four purusarthas, namely dharma (duty), artha ( acquisition of
  wealth), kama (gratification of desire) and moksa (attainment of
  emancipation). Among these, kama is said to signify the attainment of
  happiness and moksa is said to signify the eradication of
  mis&lt;p.85&gt;eries. Artha is a visible means of gratifying our desires,
  while dharma an invisible means of attaining emancipation. Thus kama and
  moksa are said to be goals, while artha and dharma are means of their
  attainment respectively. It may be argued here that if 'purpose' is taken as
  a ground of classification of 'Vidya', then the three vedas (Trayi) and
  Anviksiki (the science of reasoning) should be admitted as non-different,
  since both of them aim at the same goal, i. e, the attainment of
  emancipation; whereas, Anviksiki and Trayi are separately enumerated. So the
  classification does not seem to be based on the difference in regard to the
  four human goals; namely dharma, artha, kama and moksa. The answer to this is
  that it cannot be denied that vedas and the science of reasoning ( Anviksiki)
  aim at the same goal, i.e . the attainment of emancipation. Despite this
  fact, anviksiki is of supreme importance among the Vidyas, as it falls within
  the sphere of rational thinkers and it aids all the vidyas. And it is because
  of this that the vedas (Trayi) and anviksiki, though aiming at the same goal
  are different from each other. Anviksiki aids all the branches of learning
  because it is the science of logic. Indeed, the validity of all Vidyas
  (learnings) can be strengthened or established by the science of reasoning.
  That is to say, in order to establish its validity, each branch of learning
  has to conform to the rules of logic. It may be asked: This sastra deals with
  perception etc. yet how is it that it is to be known only as Nyayasastra (-
  the science of inference or syllogistic argument) ? The answer to this is
  that this is so because samsaya etc. are mentioned, defined and examined and
  thus fully expounded as accessory to the purity of the act of ratiocination
  (syllogistic argument). That is to say, Doubt and the other categories have
  been enunciated with a view to indicate clearly the distinctive subjects
  dealt with by this science, and the considering of the two sides of any issue
  constitute the process of reasoning. Thus though it deals with perception
  etc. also, it is known as Nyayasastra since the process of reasoning is the
  principal subject &lt;p.86&gt; of this science and the categories like Doubt
  etc. which provoke the process of reasoning are dealt with as subsidiary to
  it. And it is because of this only that though other Sastras may be put forth
  by means of inferences or subjected to inferential thinking yet they are not
  Nyayasastra; for, we do not find topics beginning from doubt ( Samsaya) and
  ending with 'Ground of Defeat' (Nigrahasthana) treated in them as we find
  here. Thus because Syllogistic reasoning is predominant here, this alone is
  Nyayavidya ( the science of reasoning) and it is the supreme science because
  it aids all the branches of learning and brings about true knowledge which is
  the cause of final emancipation.</font></td>

  may be asked : Does true knowledge bring about emancipation immediately after
  it ( i.e. true knowledge) comes into existence ? The answer is that it does
  not do so immediately; but true knowledge first annihilates false knowledge (
  Mithyajnana), then the cessation of false knowledge brings about the
  annihilation of Defect (dosa) and in their turn Activity (Pravrtti) , Birth
  (Janman) and pain (duhkha) are annihilated and this ultimately leads to the
  final emancipation. In this context Bhasarvajna quotes the Nyayasutra - There
  is cessation of each member of the follow ing series - Pain, birth, activity,
  defect and false knowledge; the cessation of that which follows, bringing
  about the annihilation of that which precedes it; and this ultimately leads to
  emancipation. This beginningless chain based on causal relation between pain,
  birth, activity, defect and false knowledge is metempsychosis or mundane life
  (samsara). This should be taken as understood while considering the second
  sutra. This sutra examines as to whether the non-rise of true knowledge and
  the rise of true knowledge bring about metempsychosis (mundane life) and
  emancipation respectively; so that the seeker of emancipation could
  ascertain<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&lt;p.87&gt; the capacity of
  true knowledge to accomplish emancipation and zealously proceed to bring
  about true knowledge. Moreover, in order to suggest that metempsychosis is
  beginningless false knowledge, defect, activity, birth and pain are stated in
  inverse order in the sutra.</td>

  class="font5">Now, let us be clear about the nature of false knowledge etc.
  False or erroneous knowledge in regard to the objects to be known, i.e. the
  prameyas like Atman etc., is of diverse kinds - (i) the knowledge that things
  like Atman, antahkarana (internal organ) etc. do not exist, though they in
  fact exist; (ii) knowledge of what is non-atman as Atman, (iii) knowledge of
  objects as non-different, though they are in fact different; (iv) knowledge
  of a thing as pure though it is really impure; (v) regarding someone else as
  agent in respect of one's miseries though they are caused by one's own self;
  (iv) knowing one's own self as agent in respect of acts done by others; (vii)
  looking upon what is disgusting as agreeable; (viii) knowing what is
  non-eternal as eternal; (ix) regarding what deserves to be rejected as worthy
  of being accepted. From the above described erroneous knowledge proceeds
  attachment to the agreeable or aversion for the disagreeable. Motivated by
  this attachment or aversion a man proceeds to act through his speech, body
  and mind. Then in respect of such a man, merits and demerits start being
  accumulated. Under the influence of attachment divine objects that are to be
  enjoyed in a next birth as well as to non-divine objects, a man performs acts
  like sacrifices enjoined in the scriptures and through the performance of
  such acts he accumulates merits to his credit. On the other hand, under the
  influence of attachment to objects that are seen here on the earth a man
  proceeds to perform acts that are prohibited<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>&lt;p.88&gt; in scriptures and fails to perform those acts that are
  enjoined in scriptures and thus he accumulates sins or demerits. Even under
  the influence of aversion a man most probably fails to perform the acts that
  are enjoined in scriptures and thus he accumulates demerits only. As these
  stores of merits and demerits can be effected through the instrumentality of
  activity, they are signified here in the Nyayasutra by the word 'pravrtti'
  (activity). That is to say, the effect is signified by the name of the
  instrument. And owing to the merits and the demerits that are accumulated, a
  man takes birth, characterised by the association of Atman with body,
  sense-organs etc. in the various domains of gods, human-beings and lower
  beings (animals, birds, etc). Consequently there occur miseries of various
  kinds like residing in womb etc. as well as false knowledge. Then again
  defects etc. arise due to erroneous knowledge and thus once again the cycle
  of erroneous knowledge, defects, activity, birth and pain starts revolving.
  This incessant chain of causes and effects itself is Samsara
  (metempsychosis). However, when false knowledge is annihilated by true
  knowledge, defects which are the effects caused by false knowledge, would
  automatically fade away in the absence of their causes. And when defects are
  annihilated, the activity caused by them naturally comes to a stop; and when
  activity ceases, there is no birth caused by it, and hence, pains effected by
  birth recede. And the complete cessation of pains is itself final
  emancipation.</font><font class="font0"> Here it may be noted that in
  Bhasarvajna's own view, final emancipation is not merely cessation of pains;
  but there does exist positive happiness in emancipation.</font></td>

  class="font5">It may be asked : What is signified by this apaya of false
  knowledge ?</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Does it
  signify the non-origination of false knowledge ? &lt;p.89&gt;Or does it mean
  the annihilation of false knowledge ? Now, as to the first alternative,
  non-origination ( prag·abhava ) of erroneous knowledge cannot be brought
  about by true knowledge, since it being beginningless cannot be accomplished
  by anything.</font><font class="font0"> To put it otherwise, non-origination
  of anything does not require any cause as it is there from times immemorial.
  So true knowledge is not required to bring about the non-origination of false
  knowledge. </font><font class="font5">Now as regards the second alternative,
  the annihilation of erroneous knowledge occurs even in the absence of the
  rise of true knowledge, because all kinds of knowledge are very quickly
  perishable. Moreover, even in respect of annihilation no distinction due to
  the cause is observed.</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, all
  annihilations are similar and anyone of them cannot be distinguished from
  another on the ground of its being affected by some particular cause. </font><font
  class="font5">Besides, it is also not correct to say that once false
  knowledge is removed by true knowledge another false knowledge will not
  arise. As for instance, even when false knowledge of serpent etc. in regard
  to rope etc. is removed by the true knowledge of rope etc; again the false
  knowledge of serpent in regard to rope is seen to arise at another time.
  Similarly, the obstruction of the cause (so that it could not give rise to
  the effect) cannot be established by inference.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">It is also not proper to say that when false knowledge is
  annihilated by true knowledge, defects are bound to disappear. For, we find
  persons, who are endowed with true knowledge, rendered as if blind due to
  their attachment to and aversion for objects. Against this, it may be argued
  that those who are found to be overpowered by attachment etc. are not really
  endowed with true knowledge. This argument is not tenable, for against this
  argument it can be asked as to whether the rise of true knowledge is not
  possible even in the case of those who expound the Nyayasastra.</font><font
  class="font0"> As a matter of fact, even such persons cannot be said to be
  endowed with true knowledge, inasmuch as they are seen to have attachment to
  their own sastra and aversion for the sastra of others. Then the question
  arises : </font><font class="font5">By what means can true knowledge be
  brought about ?</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, it is not possible
  to point out any<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&lt;p.90&gt; specific
  means for the origination of true knowledge. And so its origination would
  have to be admitted as accidental. </font><font class="font5">On the other
  hand, the subsidence (Upasama) of attachment etc is found for some time even
  in the case of those who are in fact devoid of true knowledge. But absolute
  cessation of attachment etc. is found in the life of none. Even great yogins
  like Hari, Hiranyagarbha and others are heard to have been overpowered by
  attachment etc. towards some objects.</font><font class="font0"> Thus no
  person is found, who is completely devoid of attachment etc. </font><font
  class="font5">And it is for this reason that true knowledge, even though
  determined by ratiocination is not the cause of total cessation of attachment
  etc. Moreover, it is also not proper to say that when defects are
  annihilated, the activity provoked by them automatically ceases. For, none,
  while living could remain completely inactive, just like a stone.</font><font
  class="font0"> And merit and demerit signified by activity ( pravrtti )
  cannot possibly be avoided. For,</font><font class="font5"> if a man in order
  to avert merit does not perform an act enjoined in scriptures and does not
  refrain from an act that is prohibited, then demerit is bound to be
  accumulated; as it is a natural consequence of neglecting what is prescribed
  and of doing what is prohibited in scriptures.</font><font class="font0"> In
  contrast to this, merit is bound to arise if one performs what is enjoined
  and refrains from what is prohibited in the scriptures.</font><font
  class="font5"> It is not possible for a man to keep away both merit and
  demerit</font><font class="font0"> at a time. Whenever he does something, he
  does accumulate either merit or demerit. </font><font class="font5">Thus when
  activity cannot cease, it follows that the cessation of birth will not be
  possible; and when cessation of future birth is not possible, final
  emancipation, characterised by the complete cessation of pain, would also not
  be possible.</font></td>

    <font class="font5">The answer to this is as follows :</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">The cessation of false knowledge
  signifies the non-origination of that false knowledge which is yet to come,
  and the annihilation of that which has already come into existence.</font><font
  class="font0"> That is to say, the future origination of false knowledge can
  be prevented and the annihilation of such a knowledge as has already
  originated can be effected. </font><font class="font5">As regards the
  objection that non-origination of false knowledge is beginningless, so it
  cannot be said to be brought about by true knowledge, the answer is that this
  is something that is not recognised by the Naiyayika also. He does not say
  that non-origination of false knowledge which was previously non-existent is
  brought about by true knowledge. What he wants to say is this : Demerit or
  the like which serves as the cause of the ending of the state of
  non-origination</font><font class="font0"> (i.e. which paves the way for the
  origination of false knowledge) </font><font class="font5">can be prevented
  from doing so by true knowledge. As for the contention that the obstruction
  of the cause</font><font class="font0"> (so that it could not produce its
  effect) </font><font class="font5">is not supported by reason; the answer is
  that it is not so. As for example, when a post becomes an object of true
  knowledge, we do not find false knowledge arising in regard to that post.</font><font
  class="font0"> That is to say, true knowledge of post is found capable of
  arresting the rise of false knowledge in regard to the same. </font><font
  class="font5">Indeed we never find that the false determination of a thing as
  other than what it really is, arises after sublating the true determination
  in regard to the same thing.</font><font class="font0"> This means that once
  true knowledge is produced in respect of a thing, it cannot be sublated by
  erroneous knowledge of the same. </font><font class="font5">Moreover, like
  between true knowledge and false knowledge, between their impressions also,
  the relation of sublator and sublated can be inferred.</font><font
  class="font0"> That is to say, the impression of true knowledge must be
  capable of sublating the impression of false knowledge. </font><font
  class="font5">And the impression produced by the true knowledge which has
  arisen just once is capable of sublating even the<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&lt;p.92&gt; multitude of impressions
  caused by false knowledge having the same object as that of the true
  knowledge. Moreover, having done this, that impression caused by true
  knowledge, produces a memory which is capable of giving rise to specific
  practical behaviour and which imitates the shape of true knowledge.</font><font
  class="font0"> If a man once realises that it is a mirage and not real water,
  then on future occasions he remembers it and does not run towards it.
  Likewise a man who knows things as they really are, behaves in such a way
  that merit and demerit do not accumulate and bondage does not occur to him. </font><font
  class="font5">Then the impressions caused by the repetitive occurence of true
  knowledge accumulate day by day, and the impressions produced by false
  knowledge dwindle gradually.</font><font class="font0"> This process of
  accumulation of some impressions and dwindling of others goes on </font><font
  class="font5">until the impressions caused by false knowledge are completely
  destroyed. Subsequently demerit also does not give rise to any false
  knowledge because it does not have any auxiliary cause</font><font
  class="font0"> (e.g. impressions caused by demerit, etc.) </font><font
  class="font5">and because it is arrested by true knowledge or by its
  impression; and just without giving rise to false knowledge, demerit fully
  perished some time by virtue of some cause. And when demerit is thus
  annihilated, false knowledge can never arise in the absence of its cause.
  Thence the state of non-origination of false knowledge never goes away,</font><font
  class="font0"> that is to say, false knowledge gets no chance to arise.</font><font
  class="font5"> </font><font class="font0">Thus</font><font class="font5"> the
  state of non-origination of false knowledge being thus maintained is said
  figuratively to have been brought about by true knowledge.</font><font
  class="font0"> That is to say, the true knowledge never allows the
  non-origination of false knowledge to recede giving place to origination of
  false knowledge. In the presence of true knowledge false knowledge cannot
  originate. Thus the state of non-origination of false knowledge is always
  maintained because of true knowledge.</font></td>

  class="font5">Now, as to the objection that there cannot be any distinction
  in the various destructions, the answer is that it is not so; for distinction
  between two destructions is seen. As for example, though a lamp (flame of a
  lamp) perishes at every moment, its effect - all behaviour connected with the
  eye, viz. calling things visible and the like, and accumulation of collyrium
  does not stop. But when the lamp is &lt;p.93&gt; put out with the help of
  water, etc. no such effect,</font><font class="font0"> e.g. collyrium etc. </font><font
  class="font5">can</font><font class="font0"> have scope to </font><font
  class="font5">come into existence and we say: There is no lamp.</font><font
  class="font0"> Thus the natural putting out of lamp and its extinguishment by
  water etc are clearly two different kinds of destruction. And thus even in
  destructions there is difference due to their causes being different. </font><font
  class="font5">Or we may say that destruction of false knowledge is like the
  uprooting of a plant from the soil along with its tuberous roots. When a
  plant is thus destroyed with spade etc, it cannot grow again; so when false
  knowledge along with the impressions caused by it is eradicated by true
  knowledge, it can never arise, since it is annihilated along with its roots.
  On the other hand, the true knowledge has the potency to eradicate all the
  impressions caused by false knowledge, as those impressions and true knowledge
  being opposed to each other cannot co-exist simultaneously.</font></td>

  class="font5">It may be urged that false knowledge may be destroyed in
  respect of one object</font><font class="font0">, e.g. atman, </font><font
  class="font5">still it cannot be prevented from arising in respect of another
  object</font><font class="font0">, e.g. a nacre. It is not possible to
  eradicate false knowledge regarding all objects under the Sun; and
  consequently emancipation will never be attained. The answer to this is that </font><font
  class="font5">false knowledge in regard to all objects is not the cause of
  metempsychosis, so that it should be sought to be eradicated. It is the false
  knowledge in regard to Atman and the like alone;</font><font class="font0">
  that is the cause of metempsychosis; so it is this alone that is sought to be
  annihilated. </font><font class="font5">And when the nature of the object to
  be known (prameya) like Atman etc. is truly determined, false knowledge in
  regard to such objects never arises again; just as when the nature of a
  pillar is truly determined, false knowledge in regard to the same does not
  arise again. It may be contended that as said above, even when the true
  knowledge in respect of pillar etc. is attained, false knowledge is bound to
  arise in regard to the same at another time. The answer is; True, in the case
  of a person who cannot maintain that particular continuity of cognitions and
  their linking up with each other (Visesanusandhana), in his case false
  knowledge may &lt;p.94&gt; spring up again. However</font><font class="font0">
  </font><font class="font5">in the case of a seeker of emancipation, the
  particular continuity of true cognitions linked with each other - e.g. 'Atman
  is an entity separate from body etc.' is not interrupted. Being afraid of
  metempsychosis the seeker of emancipation endeavours day and night</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">to more and more firmly concentrate
  and meditate on what he has ascertained. In this context the sutra of revered
  Aksapada may be noted - &quot;There should also be repetition of the study of
  the discipline, as also friendly discussion with persons learned in the
  science.&quot; This should be done for the purpose of defending one's own
  determined knowledge.</font><font class="font0"> What is taught by Aksapada
  through the above-mentioned sutra is this that one should make the mental
  impression ( Bhavana ) firm by means of continuous repetition of the study of
  the sastra. </font><font class="font5">It may be asked: As there are endless
  individuals even of the knowable objects like Atman etc., how could it be
  possible to bring about the complete cessation of false knowledge in respect
  of all these? The answer is that it is not so; for, a man can determine the
  true nature of all individual souls or the like by taking only their genus
  (atmatva) into consideration. Thus when Atmatva soulness is determined, false
  knowledge which is the cause of metempsychosis would come to an end. Indeed
  even in the case of a particular object</font><font class="font0"> like
  Atman, </font><font class="font5">it is not that all false knowledge is
  required to be annihil&lt;p.95&gt;ated. But it is that which is the
  root-cause of metempsychosis through the instrumentality of defects</font><font
  class="font0"> (attachment and aversion) </font><font class="font5">that is
  precisely sought to be destroyed. It may be urged here that if the false
  knowledge in regard to Atman and the like is regarded as the root-cause of
  metempsychosis, then in the state of world-dissolution or the like,
  emancipation should come about, because false knowledge is not possible then.
  The answer to this is that it is not so, because even at the time of
  world-dissolution or the like impressions of false knowledge continue to
  exist, as the complete eradication of impressions is not possible at that
  stage. Therefore, with reference to all embodied souls, it is true to say
  that metempsychosis is caused by false knowledge. However in the case of
  some, such a knowledge (erroneous knowledge) arises in respect of the
  objects, ātman etc. severally or jointly and that false knowledge prolongs
  metempsychosis through the instrumentality of the defects (raga-dvesa,
  attachment and aversion). And when the prameya as a whole is truly determined
  as it really is, by taking up for ascertainment its genus, viz. atmatva or
  the like; the false knowledge cannot arise again in respect of that truly
  determined object.</font><font class="font0"> This means that a seeker for
  emancipation is not required to ascertain the true nature of all individual
  things, e.g. souls. What he has to determine is the genus of the object, e.g.
  Atmatva, once it is done, false knowledge can never arise in respect of that
  object. </font><font class="font5">As for example, when a person once
  determines nectar and poison as the causes of welfare and ill-being
  respectively, he can in all cases determine things as belonging to one of
  these genera and never makes a mistake and never acts as guided by any false knowledge
  in regard to these viz. nectar and poison. Similarly on the ground of the
  determination of their genus as objects of sense-organs, all objects can be
  determined as being like poison; and when once this is done, the false
  knowledge which is the cause of attachment, never arises in respect of these
  sense-objects definitely known as such. On the other hand, when all causes of
  pain are determined as being impossible to be warded off, inasmuch as they
  are sure &lt;p.96&gt; to bring about for us the fruits of our own deeds</font><font
  class="font0"> (- wrong act performed is sure to bring about pain-),</font><font
  class="font5"> false knowledge which is the cause of aversion never arises in
  respect of those determined causes of pain. Similarly, a person determines
  Atman as separate from body etc. as transmigrating to another world, and as
  being endowed with the properties like existence, eternality etc. And after
  such a determination, even in the case of such a person the knowledge of the
  difference of the soul and body etc. does not again become the cause of
  delusion, that is to say, does not allow delusion to arise. Thus false
  knowledge in respect of particular knowable objects, which is the cause of
  ill-being, should be everywhere understood to be annihilated by true
  knowledge of the thing as it really is.</font></td>

  <td class=xl65 width=856 style='border-top:none;border-left:none;width:642pt'>Justification
  of the Annihilation of Defects by the Annihilation of False knowledge : <font
  class="font5">As to the argument that though false knowledge may be
  destroyed, the destruction of defects does not come about; since defects like
  attachment etc. are possible even in persons who have acquired true
  knowledge. It may be said that this argument also in not justifiable; because
  it is seen otherwise. We find that when false knowledge is eradicated, the
  destruction of defects does follow as a natural consequence. To wit, hatred
  caused by the false determination of a friend as an enemy is expelled by true
  knowledge as soon as the erroneous knowledge of a friend as an enemy is
  dispelled. Similarly, attachment due to the false ascertainment of mother as
  a beloved is expelled by the true knowledge of mother as mother, when the
  false knowledge of mother as belo&lt;p.97&gt;ved is dispelled. Many such
  instances should be borne in mind. Moreover, there is no possibility of
  attachment in the absence of false knowledge. Also it is said in the
  Nyayasutra - 'Of these (Desire, Hatred and Illusion), Illusion is the worser
  evil, as for one who is not under Illusion, the others do not appear'.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Here one may raise an objection
  that even in the case of some persons who have understood the purport of
  Sastras, it is found that they are under the influence of attachment etc. The
  answer to this is : This is true. However even in the case of such persons
  who have already acquired true knowledge from sastras, the internal defect
  viz. demerit remains very powerful; and it overcomes true knowledge and
  causes notions likely to create attraction in regard to a thing. And it
  (internal defect, demerit ) causes notions likely to create repulsion in
  regard to a thing. And as a matter of fact, both of them,- notions that
  likely to create attraction and repulsion, are nothing but false
  determinations in regard to things.</font><font class="font0"> In short,
  internal defect, if it is powerful, overcomes true knowledge and gives rise
  to false determination in respect of things. </font><font class="font5">And
  then notions that likely to create attraction and repulsion, give rise to
  attachment and aversion respectively</font><font class="font0">. The same
  point could be elaborated and further illustrated as follows: </font><font
  class="font5">The false determination is seen to be arising from internal
  defect (demerit etc.) even in the case of a person who has true knowledge. As
  for instance though a man ascertains a certain quarter as the eastern
  direction with the help of some indicative signs like sunrise etc, he is
  sometimes seen to be confused about the direction due to the influence of
  demerit. Similarly, owing to the particular disease of eyes called Timira a
  man determines that there are two moons, even &lt;p.98&gt; though he has formerly
  ascertained that there is only one moon. Such examples can be cited with
  reference to false determination caused by some defect in tongue etc. also.
  But the person realises that his false determination was due to the defect of
  his sense-organ; and he removes that defect of sense-organ etc. by means of
  some particular medicine and consequently dispels the false determination. So
  also a seeker for emancipation, who has understood the real purport of
  sastras realises that the, false determinations, in the form of notions
  likely to create attraction and repulsion, with regard to the objects desired
  and non-desired, arise in him due to the influence of adrsta (unseen
  potentiality of past deeds) and he takes resort to meditation employing all
  aids (angas) to Yoga such as Yama ( abstentions- ahimsa etc.), Niyama (
  observances- Samtosa etc.) and the like and thereby destroys the force of
  adrsta. And thus he wards off wrong notions, likely to create attraction and
  repulsion in regard to the objects. In this context the Nyayasutra may be
  noted - &quot;For that purpose (of attaining Final Release ) there should be
  purification of the soul, by means of restraints and observances and such
  other methods (e.g. eating only particular kind of food etc.) of internal
  discipline as may be learnt from the science of Yoga.&quot;</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">On the other hand, those who are
  overcome by negligence and idleness are not able to achieve even other goals
  (Wealth, love, religious means etc.), much less emancipation.</font><font
  class="font0"> Thus in the case of a person who is not negligent and who
  employs himself in meditation, defects are eradicated, when the false
  knowledge is annihilated by true knowledge. But how could there come about
  the eradication of attachment &lt;p.99&gt; etc. in the case of those who are
  devoid of true knowledge, when they like simpletons and mad men are endowed
  with delusion, the source of all defects? It is said - &quot;Whatever
  detachment there is in persons who are devoid of true knowledge, whatever
  happiness there is in persons who are dependent on others, shade due to cloud
  and the fire set in dry grass - all these perish immediately&quot;. That is
  to say, the state of being free from attachment does not endure long if the
  person does not have true knowledge in respect of things.</font></td>

  of the objection that even Yogins are over-powered by Attachment etc : <font
  class="font5">It was urged by the oppenent that even Yogins are heard to have
  been a prey to attachment etc., and this supports the view that true
  knowledge even though it consists of reflection (attentive consideration)
  cannot become the cause of the cessation of attachment etc. But this also is
  not proper, for he who says so does not know the real nature of the true
  knowledge that is * cintamaya * - that is constituted by reflection. </font><font
  class="font0">What is meant by 'true knowledge consisting of reflection'</font><font
  class="font5"> </font><font class="font0">( i.e. Cintamaya Tattvajnana) </font><font
  class="font5">is</font><font class="font0"> the stabilised reflection (
  Sthiribhuta Bhavana ) of the conception regarding the objects which are
  four-fold, (i) &lt;p.100&gt; heya-that which is fit to be discarded ( e.g.
  pain ) along with its causes (i.e. ignorance and desire, merit and demerit as
  leading to pain ); (ii) hanam atyantikam - that which completely annihilates
  pain i.e. true knowledge); (iii) tasya upayah - the means of its destruction
  (i.e. the scientific treatises); and (iv) adhigantavya - the goal to be
  attained (i. e. Highest Good)</font><font class="font5">. </font><font
  class="font0">That is to say, </font><font class="font5">the stabilised
  meditation (Sthiribhuta Bhavana) of the conception of the four-fold prameya (
  Heya etc. ) is called 'Cintamaya tattvajnana' and not mere Yogic knowledge.
  It is not right to think that all yogins are seekers for emancipation; or
  that all yogins posses true knowledge. Many a yogin employs himself in the
  practice of yoga in order to acquire knowledge. Similarly various dharanas
  (contemplations) related to yoga (or related to enjoyment) are expounded in
  the Sastras composed by Jaigisavya and others. Moreover, it is known from
  tradition that Sanatkumara &lt;p.101&gt; who had become superior even to
  Hari, Hiranyagarbha and others on account of his excellence in Yogic powers,
  was defeated by revered Aksapada, when the former held a different view in
  regard to the supreme Lord. Therefore merely by becoming a yogin, a person
  cannot achieve the state of being endowed with true knowledge; nor the state
  of being free from attachment etc. It is, therefore, concluded that delusion
  can be destroyed only by true knowledge, the real nature of which has been
  explained above. And when delusion (false knowledge) is brought to an end,
  the eradication of defects, ( i.e. raga, dvesa) follows as a natural
  consequence.</font></td>

  class="font5">Further, it was argued that non-production of future merit and
  demerit cannot reasonably be upheld, because the means of such merit and
  demerit cannot be possibly warded off. But this argument also cannot be
  maintained. For</font><font class="font0"> we have already seen how defects
  (raga, etc.) can be warded off. Indeed, </font><font class="font5">these
  defects (raga, dvesa) are the principal cause of merit and demerit. In the
  absence of this principal cause, merit and demerit cannot arise even though
  other causes may be present there. For example, if the seed of rice is not
  sown in the soil, its sprout cannot shoot forth</font><font class="font0">
  even though other causes, namely, water, air etc. are present. </font><font
  class="font5">In this &lt;p.102&gt; context the Nyaya-sutra runs- 'For the
  man whose aberrations have been destroyed, activity does not lead to
  recrudescence.' We have a sutra of Patanjali to the same effect - 'The
  latent-deposit of karman has its root in the hindrances and may be felt in a
  birth seen or in a birth unseen.' Further, the next Yogasutra says - 'So long
  as the root exists, there will be fruition from it (that is) birth (and)
  length-of-life (and) kind of experience.' (Woods). A syllogistic argument is
  also put forth proving this - The person we are discussing here (viz. one who
  is free from attachment and aversion) cannot be connected with merit and
  demerit ( or merit-demerit do not accrue to him), though he is engaged in
  activity, since he is free from defects (attachment etc.), like the Great
  Lord (Mahesvara). Thus in the case of that person alone, all whose defects
  (raga, dvesa) are destroyed, true knowledge, being absolutely pure, becomes
  capable of removing the &lt;p.103&gt;impurity of merit and demerit. But in
  the case of a person, whose defects (raga etc.) are not destroyed, even
  though he is a yogin, true knowledge is not capable of removing the impurity
  of merit and demerit, just as water</font><font class="font0">, which
  normally cleans cloth etc., can not remove dirt </font><font class="font5">when
  it is itself turbid</font><font class="font0"> (i.e. dirty). </font><font
  class="font5">To illustrate the point another instance may be cited : Just as
  fire, though fully kindled, cannot burn a thing which can be burnt, e.g.
  cotton etc., when it is associated with some specific medicinal herb so even
  the fire in the form of knowledge cannot burn the karman which is associated
  with defects ( raga, dvesa). Moreover, the belief that karman can be burnt by
  the fire in the form of knowledge is well established in all sastras of yoga
  as well as in the upanisads. So it is not baseless.</font></td>

  bodies in accordance with his karman at all places, and thus by creating
  different bodies, the yogin experiences simultaneously various fruits,
  desired and non-desired.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Now
  karmans that can effect Brahmahatya (killing of a Brahmin), Asvamedha
  sacrifice etc. turn away after performing their function and thence again
  there is an accumulation of karman. This being the case, how could one ever
  bring about the absolute destruction of such karmans ( by means of fire in
  the form of knowledge )? Further, it is also not possible to attain the state
  of being free from klesas ( afflictions), because karman &lt;p.105&gt; which
  is the cause of attachment etc. would recede only after effecting attachment
  etc. Besides, this view in regard to karman is opposed to the concept of
  expiation (prayascitta) or the like which is supposed to prevent a (bad)
  karman from coming to fruition. Moreover, demerit even though it may be meant
  for attraction, etc. still brings about just pain and after doing this it
  perishes, whereas merit perishes after bringing about just pleasure; but as
  in the case of threads, etc. the effect does not arise in the absence of the
  auxiliary causes, so here also the effect may not arise due to the absence of
  the auxiliary causes. Moreover, the time when these karmans will yield their
  fruit is uncertain.</font></td>

  argument of the opponent emphasises the point that no deed is ever lost. Each
  karman infallibly gives rise to its fruit and then only it comes to an end.
  Again, it is not possible to burn all karman by the fire in the form of
  knowledge or to experience all of them simultaneously due to the
  extraoridinary power of yoga; because no one can say when a particular karman
  will yield its fruit, as karmans are innumerable and the time of their
  fruition is uncertain. <font class="font5">In reply to this, Bhāsarvajna says</font><font
  class="font0"> that this type of consideration also is not baseless. </font><font
  class="font5">This is also one view; and there is nothing wrong in this.
  However Acāryas declare that in the case of a person who, aiming only at
  realisation of God, employs himself in learning the sastras as well as in
  practising the eight aids to yoga ( Yama, Niyama etc.) merit and demerit
  perish fully, leaving no trace behind, after giving rise to pleasure and pain
  caused by contentment and depression ( Samtosa-kheda) respectively. On the
  other hand, it is accepted on the strength of Agama pramana that a yogin can
  experience all pleasures and pains simultaneously. If this be admitted, then
  what offence has been committed by the burning of karman by the fire in the
  form of knowledge that it is not accepted even though it is established in
  all agamas ?</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, the view that karmans
  can be scorched &lt;p.106&gt; by the fire in the form of knowledge should be
  accepted, as it is supported by the sastras. </font><font class="font5">Neverthless
  the scriptural statement that 'No karman comes to an end until it is
  experienced' is significant and purposeful inasmuch as it is applicable to
  those who have not performed the ritual of expiation (prayascitta) and to
  those who have not attained true knowledge.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">Again, it may be urged that if knowledge is admitted to be
  capable of burning all karmans, the accumulation of merit (dharma) brought
  about by yoga would be contradicted.</font><font class="font0"> That is to
  say, since a yogin is necessarily a Jnanin, the accumulation of merit would
  not be possible, as in the presence of knowledge all karman, merit or demerit
  is destroyed. </font><font class="font5">The answer to this is that it is not
  so, for, in the case of a yogin whose defects (raga, dvesa) are not
  completely destroyed; the said accumulation of merit (dharma) would be
  possible. Or this could be explained otherwise : Just as when subliminal
  impressions of restriction (nirodha-samskara) rise up, the impressions of
  emergence ( vyutthana Samskara) become invisible, so merit which is conducive
  to the realisation of God is accumulated, while that which is a hindrance to
  it is dispelled. Just as by concentrating the mind on a single object a
  person can accumulate the impressions of that object and the impressions
  contrary to the former would be naturally destroyed; so merit and demerit the
  cause of metempsychosis, of a person desirous of being free from
  metempsychosis, would be destroyed by the practice of continuous knowledge of
  God, as they are opposed to meditation. </font><font class="font0">That is to
  say, they cannot survive when one reaches the stage of meditation. </font><font
  class="font5">And till a person achieves the realisation of God he continues
  to accumulate merit (dharma) which is the cause of meditation. That merit
  also turns away as soon as its task is over. And since in the</font><font
  class="font0"> &lt;p.107&gt; </font><font class="font5">case of this person,
  the defects (raga etc.) are completely dispelled, future merit and demerit
  would never arise. Consequently, on account of merit and demerit being
  eradicated, the series of births comes to an end. And birth being prevented,
  sufferings natureally come to a stop.</font><font class="font0"> It is thus
  that one can attain emancipation by means of true knowledge. </font><font
  class="font5">The attainment of emancipation can be thus explained.</font><font
  class="font0"> The Nyayavidya enables a man to attain true knowledge of Atman
  etc, which in turn leads to Final Release.</font></td>

  this chapter before we take up the problem of validity or invalidity of
  knowledge, it is necessary to make it clear what the term ‘prama’ signifies.
  The Sanskrit word 'jnana‘ is used to mean all kinds of cognition, cognition
  acquired through perception etc., as also memory, doubt, illusion etc.
  According to the Nyaya tradition, cognition is divided into two great heads
  of anubhava (presentation) and smrti (memory). Anubhava is presentative
  knowledge of objects, whereas smrti is a reproduction of previous experience
  and is knowledge produced from mental impression alone. Anubhava is further
  subdivided into yathartha (valid cognition, prama) and ayathartha (invalid
  cognition, aprama). Of these, yathartha anubhava (prama) is of four
  kinds-perceptual cognition (pratyaksa), inferential cognition (anumiti),
  analogical cognition (upamiti) and verbal testimony (Sabda). Aprama or
  ayathartha anubhava is further generally classified into doubt (samsaya)
  error (viparyaya) and hypothetical reasoning ( tarka ). According to the
  Nyaya, dream-cognitions are memory-cognitions and are incorrect (ayathartha).
  Similarly memory is subdivided into yathartha (correct) and ayathartha
  (incorrect). It may be noted that memory is not prama, since it is not
  presentative in character. It is of two kinds, yathartha (correct) and
  ayathartha (incorrect) according as it agrees or does not agree with the real
  nature of the objects remembered ( or is produced by valid cognition or by
  invalid cognition). Hence a cognition in order to be prama must be yathartha
  (true) and presentative in character. It is cognition which is free from
  uncertainty or doubt (asamdigdha), true or corresponding to its object
  (yathartha) and presentative in character (anubhavatmaka). Hence prama
  excludes all kinds of non-valid cognition such as memory, error, doubt,
  hypothetical reasoning, because they are not presentative or not true or not
  certain.</td>

  are different views even in regard to the exact meaning of pramana. Some
  (i.e. Mimamsakas) say that the means which enables us to cognise the object
  which is not yet known is pramana. Some others ( i.e. Sautrantikas ) hold
  that vijnana endowed with form, while taking the shape of object is pramana.
  Some others ( i.e. vaibhasikas and others) claim that the capacity of vijnana
  that is formless to reveal itself or things other than itself is pramana.
  Still others (i.e. Naiyayikas) accept that whatever is ( the most efficient )
  means of ( upalabdhi ) apprehension ( i.e. prama, valid cognition) is
  pramana. It is necessary to keep in mind the meaning of pramana accepted by a
  particular school while we discuss the problem of validity or invalidity with
  reference to that particular school. The Nyayasara begins with the general
  definition of pramana. By this definition, viz. <font class="font5">Samyak-
  anubhava-sadhanam Pramanam - a means of right apprehension is called pramana,
  the means of right apprehension (pramana) is precisely separated or
  distinguished from the semblances of pramana ( pramanabhasa ) which belong to
  the same class; i.e. the class of pramana; as well as from prameyas which
  belong to a class other than that of pramana. In the same manner
  &lt;p.110&gt; the definition of perception etc. should be interpreted as

  of the term 'Samyak' (Right) in the Definition : Bhasarvajna says that the
  word 'Samyak' is inserted in the general definition of pramana, given in the
  Nyayasara, in order to exclude doubt and illusion from the range of Prama
  (valid apprehension). That is to say, the means of right apprehension alone
  is called pramana; while the means of wrong apprehension (-doubt or
  illusion-) is not pramana. This statement is specifically directed against <font
  class="font5">one who holds that there is nothing belonging to the same
  class, viz. the class of pramana, which is required to be excluded by the
  definition. </font><font class="font0">Here Bhasarvajna seems to be referring
  to the view held by the Prabhakara Mimamsaka according to whom anubhuti or
  direct apprehension is synonymous with prama- that is to say all anubhuti is
  prama; while smrti or memory, being different from prama, is non-valid. In
  this view, all apprehension is valid. As for example, when we see silver in
  an oyster-shell, the direct apprehension in the form of 'this' and the memory
  of silver are both indiscriminately intermingled with each other. In fact,
  both of them viz. direct apprehension (in the form of 'this') and memory (of
  silver) are in themselves right. The error is due to not discriminating
  between the elements of apprehension and remembrance. Thus according to the
  view held by the followers of the Prabhakara school of Mimamsa, no direct
  apprehension is in fact wrong.</font></td>

  from the range of anubhava (apprehension). Similarly the means giving rise to
  doubt and illusion are also sought to be excluded from the range of the means
  of valid knowledge. The rightness or wrongness of pramana (means of right
  apprehension) or of Pramanabhasa (semblance of pramana) can be determined
  from the rightness or wrongness of the fruit (i. e. apprehension). That is to
  say, if the fruit, (i.e. apprehension) that is yielded by a pramana is right,
  then the means that gives rise to such a right apprehension is regarded as
  true pramana. But if the fruit or apprehension brought about by a means of
  apprehension, is wrong, then the generative means of such a wrong

  of the Term 'Anubhava' in the general Definition of Pramana : In the
  Nyayasara, Bhasarvajna says that in order to exclude memory ( smarana ) and
  Non-knowledge (ajnana) from the sphere of knowledge, the term 'anubhava' has
  been inserted in the definition. Commenting on this in the Nyaya-bhusana,
  Bhasarvajna says that <font class="font5">by including the term 'anubhava'</font><font
  class="font0"> in the definition </font><font class="font5">Remembrance (
  smarana ) and Non-knowledge, i.e. ritual performance of sacrifice etc; are
  negatived as fruit of pramana.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">Indeed both of these are nowhere known to be expressed by the
  word 'anubhava', when their etymological explanations as signifying the state
  (bhava)</font><font class="font0"> expressed by the verbal roots (i. e. smr +
  ana = smarana (a) -jna + ana » (a)jnana) are given. That is to say, what is
  directly apprehanded or presented is called 'anubhava’. Though &lt;p.113&gt;
  Remembrance (Smarana) and Non-knowledge ( ajnana, sacrifice etc.) are types
  of knowledge, yet they are different from 'anubhava'. Hence means of
  Ramembrance and Non-knowledge cannot be called Pramana, though they may be
  right. Only that means of knowledge which gives rise to right anubhava
  (presentative apprehension) is called pramana. In fact Remembrance is a
  representative cognition, while Anubhava is a presentative cognition. Thus
  the term 'samyak' is inserted to exclude Doubt and Illusion from the sphere
  of right apprehension while the term 'anubhava' is included in the definition
  to deny Remembrance and Non-knowledge as fruits of pramana, or as resulting
  from the means of right knowledge.</font></td>

  a question may arise as to whether the validity of such a prama ( right
  apprehension ) which we obtain through pramana is intrinsic or is to be
  ascertained by some extraneous means. In this regard the Mimamsakas believe
  that validity is established by virtue of the cognition itself, while
  invalidity is established by external causes, so that a cognition must be
  taken as true unless it is proved to be otherwise. We shall refer to this
  briefly later. Against this view, the Naiyayika holds that validity and
  invalidity are established by something independent of the cognition itself.
  Here Bhasarvajna puts forth the view held by Kumarila Bhatta and his
  followers and then refutes it. <font class="font5">Advocates</font><font
  class="font0"> of the Bhatta school of Mimamsa </font><font class="font5">say</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">that</font><font class="font0"> the
  validity of cognition is certified by cognition itself, that is to say, </font><font
  class="font5">a cognition is by itself valid, nothing else is sought to prove
  its validity</font><font class="font0">.</font><font class="font5"> And so
  long as no defects or errors are found</font><font class="font0"> in the
  causes giving rise to the cognition </font><font class="font5">the
  erroneousness or falsity automatically keeps away without any effort. The
  doctrine of svatah-pramanatva (validity being intrinsic) &lt;p.114&gt;
  -signifies the non-dependence of the pieces of valid knowledge (pramāṇānām)
  on anything else in respect of their origination (utpatti), functioning
  (pravrtti) and knowledge (jnapti). On the other hand, the pieces of invalid
  knowledge are dependent on another in all these three respects, so invalidity
  is extrinsic.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">That is
  to say, false knowledge becomes invalid, being produced as dependent on the
  defect of the sense-organs etc. which is something additional to the
  knowledge</font><font class="font0"> ( i.e. the invalidity in the false
  knowledge is produced by a cause different from those causes which produce
  the knowledge itself). </font><font class="font5">On the other hand, valid
  knowledge or its validity does not depend for its being true on anything over
  and above the causal complex that produces the knowledge.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">It is not proper to say that purity
  of causes is necessary, for its causes are by their very nature free from
  impurity or defect. But as defects are adventitious ( i. e. additional to the
  causes producing knowledge), their presence is required in respect of
  apramanya (invalidity). That is to say, invalidity of knowledge is dependent
  on the presence of defects.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">And it is because of this that the gunas </font><font
  class="font0">(excellences of sense-organs etc.) </font><font class="font5">operate
  in the direction of the getting rid of these defects, and not in respect of
  the origination of pramanya</font><font class="font0"> (validity ), which
  arises immediately with the rise of knowledge. This will be still clearer if
  we take an example. </font><font class="font5">It is not that in the case of
  a man whose eyes do not suffer from any defect like partial blindness etc. (
  timiradi), validity does not arise in the absence of some added excellence
  like collyrium etc.</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, if there
  exists any defect in eyes, etc; some additional factor in the form of
  medicine is required to remove or cure it, but eyes etc. that are devoid of
  any defect do not require anything additional in bringing about valid
  knowledge. </font><font class="font5">Also, that whose necessary connection
  has not been seen both positively and negatively cannot be regarded as a
  cause simply &lt;p.115&gt; because it is present</font><font class="font0">
  (as in the case of eye-ointment which, though present, has not been
  determined as the cause of pramanya); </font><font class="font5">as this
  would lead to absurd overextension</font><font class="font0"> (- disorder in
  respect of causality - anything present would have to be regarded as the
  cause of just anything). </font><font class="font5">On the strength of the
  illustration of collyrium etc. we should infer that the functioning of other
  excellences also such as 'being testified to by reliable persons' etc. is
  exclusively in regard to the removal of defects. </font><font class="font0">Thus
  we see that valid cognition does not require in its production anything in
  addition to its own causes. This is what is said to be the self-validity (
  svatah-pramanya) of knowledge in its production (Utpatti ). </font><font
  class="font5">So also pramana or valid knowledge while it proceeds to do its
  own work that is, the act of revealing an object as it really is, does not
  require another knowledge of itself or any excellences in the causes to help
  it.</font><font class="font0"> Thus valid knowledge is not only independent
  of anything else in its own origination, but also in its own functioning
  (Pravrtti). </font><font class="font5">Similarly, in respect of its own
  knowledge or revelation ( jnapti ) also, </font><font class="font0">the valid
  knowledge</font><font class="font5"> is not dependent on anything over and
  above its own nature of being consciousness.</font><font class="font0"> That
  is to say, a valid cognition does not require another cognition for its own
  revelation, just like a lamp. </font><font class="font5">Otherwise it would
  lead to infinite series.</font><font class="font0"> The first cognition would
  require a second cognition for its own revelation and again the second would
  require a third one and so on. Thus valid knowledge does not depend on
  anything for its revelation. This is what is said to be the self-validity
  (svatah-pramanya) of knowledge in all respects, viz. in its rise, action and
  revelation ( Utpatti, pravrtti and jnapti). </font><font class="font5">On the
  other hand, invalid knowledge ( illusion etc.) does require</font><font
  class="font0"> something like defect in the sense-organ etc. in respect of
  its origination, and functioning, as shown above. Even in respect of its
  revelation invalid knowledge requires another knowledge, that is, </font><font
  class="font5">the knowledge of defects arising from some causes ( timira
  etc.) or the knowledge of a thing as being otherwise.</font><font
  class="font0"> That is to say, knowledge attained is proved &lt;p.116&gt;
  invalid when later on we come to know the defect arising from some specific
  causes like timira etc. or when we come to know that the thing is perceived
  as other than what it really is. Thus the invalidity of knowledge is to be
  ascertained by some other knowledge, while its validity is self-evident. This
  is the view held by the Bhatta Mimamsaka.</font></td>

  of the Self-Validity of knowledge And Establishment of the Doctrine That its
  Validity also is Extrinsic :<font class="font5"> As to what is said by the
  opponent that validity does not depend on anything in respect of its
  production, the answer is that it is not justifiable. For, validity certainly
  requires some specific causes like light, place, unseen principle (adrsta)
  etc. for its production. It is not that specific causes like light etc. are
  required for the production of wrong knowledge in the same form as they are
  required for the production of right knowledge. It is also not true to say
  that these specific causes only remove the defects; they certainly give rise
  to true knowledge as well; for, in the absence of such specific causes, right
  knowledge does not arise at all. Moreover, for the rise of the cognition of
  something that is to be inferred, like fire etc. antahkarana or the mind and
  the like do require the true knowledge of the linga (indicative sign) etc;
  the efficacy of which has been ascertained both positively and negatively</font><font
  class="font0"> (i. e. by the test of positive and negative concomitance).
  Thus validity of knowledge does require some specific causes for its own
  production and so it is dependent on something else in respect of its
  origination. In spite of this fact </font><font class="font5">how</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">could</font><font class="font0">
  one dare to say that </font><font class="font5">pramana or valid knowledge </font><font
  class="font0">does </font><font class="font5">not depend on anything in
  respect of its production ?</font><font class="font0"> Besides, if one
  follows the Mimamsaka's line of argument how could one say that wrong
  knowledge depends on some defect in the sense-organ etc., and so its
  invalidity is extrinsic? </font><font class="font5">For, defects like kāca
  (cataract), &lt;p.117&gt; kāmala (jaundice) etc. are nothing but a state of
  inequilibrium of the essential ingredients of the body</font><font
  class="font0"> (viz. three humours vāta=wind, pitta-bile, kapha=phlegm),
  present in the eye-ball etc. If only such a non-equilibrium of dhatus (vata
  etc.) gives rise to eye-disease like jaundice etc. one cannot say that
  invalidity of knowledge is dependent on extraneous factors in respect of its
  production etc. If it be admitted that as invalid knowledge is dependent on
  such a non-equilibrium of dhatus, its invalidity requires some extraneous
  factors for its own origination, then there would arise the contingency that
  even when there is an equilibrium of dhatus, the validity of knowledge would
  have to be said to be resulting from extraneous factors. For, so far as the
  rise of right or wrong knowledge is concerned, the state of inequilibrium of
  the dhatus and the state of equilibrium of the dhatus are equally extraneous
  conditions. If one condition could be said to produce invalidity in
  knowledge, then the other one could as well produce validity in knowledge.
  That is to say, if invalidity of knowledge is accepted as extrinsic then the
  validity of knowledge should as well be regarded as extrinsic. </font><font
  class="font5">Moreover, just like the positive existence of something, its
  absence also can be established as a cause of something by means of positive
  and negative concomitance. As for example,</font><font class="font0"> until
  there is conjunction between a fruit and a branch of a tree, </font><font
  class="font5">the act of falling down</font><font class="font0"> does not
  occur. But when there is absence of such a conjunction, the act of falling
  down does take place. So even the absence of conjunction proves to be the
  cause of the act of falling down. Similarly </font><font class="font5">when
  eyes etc. bring about valid knowledge, they do require the absence of defects
  </font><font class="font0">- which is an extraneous cause. </font><font
  class="font5">Hence the validity of knowledge is dependent on extraneous
  factors in respect of its origination.</font><font class="font0"> Here it
  should be borne in mind that according to the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika school, </font><font
  class="font5">abhāva</font><font class="font0"> also </font><font
  class="font5">is an altogether separate entity</font><font class="font0">.
  Hence like the presence of defects, the absence of defects could as well be
  said to be an extraneous cause. So like invalidity of knowledge, validity
  also is extrinsic. </font><font class="font5">It may be argued that since the
  eyes etc. do not require any additi&lt;p.118&gt;onal positive cause (
  bhavatmaka karana)</font><font class="font0"> while producing a piece of
  valid knowledge, </font><font class="font5">the validity of such a piece of
  valid knowledge is</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">regarded
  as instrinsic.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">The
  answer is that it is not tenable. For this is just a conventional belief. And
  convention could have been formed otherwise also. So just this much cannot
  prove anything. Moreover, there is no proof for the validity of knowledge
  being intrinsic in respect of its production. On the other hand, in order to
  establish that the validity of knowledge is produced by extraneous causes we
  have an inference - the validity of knowledge is produced by extraneous
  causes, because the validity not being in existence previously comes to
  exist, just like invalidity.</font></td>

  is already propounded that eyes etc. are dependent</font><font class="font0">
  on light and the like, while doing their function, i.e. the act of producing

  or the like do require extraneous causes such as light etc. But if pramana is
  taken in the sense of collocation or totality of causes (samagri), then
  functioning of this samagri would have to be accepted as being independent.
  For, eyes, light, time, place, adrsta, etc. are all included in the totality
  of causes. If this be accepted, then just as </font><font class="font5">the

  of right knowledge. When this action is to be brought about, the functioning
  of sense-organs, etc. would be required, but when it has taken place, it
  would give rise to cognition, requiring nothing for its functioning. Thus in

  class="font5">But this view is not proper. For, if knowledge is admitted as
  valid only because it is of the nature of consciousness, then there would
  arise the contingency of even erroneous knowledge being valid, since it is
  also of the nature of knowledge before it is contradicted. Contradiction or
  sublation could not properly arise in respect of consciousness which is of
  the nature of valid knowledge, for if it were to arise, there would be the
  contingency of the rise of sublation in respect of all cases of knowledge. It
  is also not proper to say that one and the same knowledge is both, pramana
  (valid knowledge) and apramana (invalid knowledge), since two contradictory
  characteristics, viz. validity and invalidity cannot reside together in one
  and the same knowledge. It may be argued that the very same thing may
  sometimes be active, at another time inactive. </font><font class="font0">Thus
  with the variance of the time factor, a thing can be both &lt;p.123&gt;
  endowed with activity and not so</font><font class="font5">.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Similarly there is no contradiction
  if we say that both</font><font class="font0">, validity and invalidity </font><font
  class="font5">could, at different times, reside in one and the same </font><font
  class="font0">knowledge. </font><font class="font5">But this argument also is
  not tenable</font><font class="font0">, says Bhasarvajna. </font><font
  class="font5">For, knowledge is evanescent, </font><font class="font0">not
  enduring. So it could not happen that a certain knowledge remains valid for
  some time and then it becomes invalid. </font><font class="font5">It is quite
  obvious that when a substance which is a substratum of some attribute is
  destroyed, it cannot have another attribute afterwards.</font><font
  class="font0"> Hence validity and invalidity cannot reside in one and the
  same knowledge even at different times, as knowledge is not enduring. </font><font
  class="font5">Again, it may be urged that even in view of the contradiction
  that is yet to come, the validity of knowledge is sought to be denied.</font><font
  class="font0"> That is to say, a particular cognition may not be sublated at
  present, but there is a possibility of its being sublated in future. Unless
  one has a conviction that a certain cognition will never be subject to
  sublation, the validity of such a cognition remains doubtful. So in view of
  future sublation validity could be denied in respect of cognition even
  earlier. </font><font class="font5">For, it is said - That knowledge alone is
  pramana, which is not contradicted at any time, at any place, by any person
  and in any condition.</font><font class="font0"> In answer to this
  Bhasarvajna retorts that </font><font class="font5">in that case
  &lt;p.124&gt; the validity cannot be said to be ascertained only on the
  ground that knowledge is of the nature of consciousness. But that knowledge
  alone can be said to be valid, which is characterised by the absence of
  contradiction in all the three times, viz. past, present and future. However
  it is not possible to ascertain beforehand whether a certain knowledge would
  or would not be contradicted in future. For, even the knowledge which has
  been ascertained as valid at present is found to be contradicted after an
  interval of time after a fortnight or a month or the like.</font><font
  class="font0"> Hence the contention of the opponent that as per general rule
  knowledge being of the nature of consciousness is valid, while validity of
  knowledge is set aside by the knowledge of defect in the cause, etc;- is not
  tenable. In fact validity and invalidity of knowledge are equally dependent
  on some extraneous factor. </font><font class="font5">Besides, it is said </font><font
  class="font0">by the Mimamsaka </font><font class="font5">&quot;And in a case
  where there is no such cognition of discrepancies, there is no reasonable
  ground for doubt&quot;</font><font class="font0"> (Ganganatha Jha).
  Explaining this Bhatta Umbeka says in his Tatparyatika on the Slokavartika
  that when the cognition arises as determining the true nature of a thing and
  in respect of which &lt;p.125&gt; there does not arise the sublative
  cognition or the cognition of any discrepancy in the means of knowledge, a
  critical thinker should not raise a doubt in the form of -'This might be
  otherwise'- only because he has seen discrepancy elsewhere. That is to say,
  when doubt does not by itself arise, it should not forcibly be raised only
  because the discrepancy is seen in a case or two elsewhere. For, it goes
  against our experience.</font></td>

  respect of valid knowledge, then how could the MImamsaka who asserts the

  before we see how Bhasarvajna refutes the Mimamsaka's view, one point needs
  to be clarified. According to the Mimamsaka, a pramana or a means of
  knowledge signifies the action of knower (jnatr-vyapara) and that action,
  residing in the knower by the relation of essential identity, is of the
  nature of consciousness or knowledge. On the other hand, the Naiyayika holds
  that a pramana or a means of knowledge signifies sense-organs or the like
  that are not yet to be accomplished but are already accomplished and that are
  directly superintended by the agent. Hence owing to the difference in the
  concepts of pramana, the concepts of pramanya also slightly differ; in the
  Mimamsaka’s view, pramanya signifies the character of being valid knowledge,
  while in Bhasarvajna's view it signifies the character of being a means of
  right knowledge.</td>

  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">The Naiyayika admits that the

  manifestation of object by that pramana.</font><font class="font0"> That is
  to say, the production of cognition by pramana actually implies the
  manifestation of the object by the same. </font><font class="font5">And it is
  true to say that cognition arises from pramana (means of valid knowledge)
  which is just not ascertained. This is true of a-pramana (a means of invalid

  this view Bhasarvajna says that t<font class="font5">his is not justifiable
  for this is due to some other reason;</font><font class="font0"> Validity of
  pramana requires as well to be ascertained by some extraneous means. Yet
  because of the deep-rooted impressions of our mind generally we at once take
  any cognition to be valid and because of the absence of such impressions we
  do not readily admit the invalidity of cognition. But merely on this ground
  it is not true to say that validity of cognition is intrinsic and invalidity
  of cognition is extrinsic. </font><font class="font5">For instance, a person
  who has seen good men in abundance, first</font><font class="font0"> arrives
  at the definite knowledge that men are good; </font><font class="font5">on
  seeing a man he takes him to be good. But, the person ascertains that a
  particular person is not good, only when he comes to apprehend some
  additional cause</font><font class="font0"> as the ground to think so.
  However, a man is just man. His goodness or wickedness is due to different
  sets of causes and goodness or wickedness can be ascertained by different
  sets of causes. But because generally we see good men we are apt to take any man
  we see as a good man. This by no means simply that goodness in man is
  instrinsic and wickedness in man is extrinsic. </font><font class="font5">Similarly
  because we find cognitions to be right in abundance, we at once tend to take
  cognitions as true, for there are deep-rooted impressions of our mind, caused
  by repeated experience of true knowledge. On the other hand, when we
  ascertain the falsity of cognition, we require the apprehension of
  &lt;p.133&gt; some other factor that leads us to think that the cognition we
  have is false.</font><font class="font0"> In this case the apprehension of
  some factor is necessary, because there are not deep-rooted impressions of
  invalid knowledge in our mind.</font><font class="font5"> If only on this
  ground the Mimamsaka has coined the expressions 'svatah-praminya’ and
  ‘paratah-pramanya'; then simply because of this the doctrine that he seeks to
  establish cannot be established.</font><font class="font0"> Hence the
  Mimamsaka cannot claim that validity is intrinsic in knowledge and invalidity
  is extrinsic. </font><font class="font5">Thus the rightness which is to be
  included and the falsity which is to be kept out can be established by means
  of pramana.</font><font class="font0"> In other words, validity and
  invalidity of knowledge are ascertained with the help of the means of
  knowledge. And so only when the apprehension is ascertained as valid, the
  means that gives rise to such a knowledge can legitimately be called pramana.
  So all means of knowledge are not pramana, but only that means which gives
  rise to right apprehension is entitled to be called pramana . </font><font
  class="font5">Hence the epithet 'samyak' (right) of anubhava 'apprehension in
  the definition of pramana is meaningful.</font></td>

  raised to the effect that there is no ground to ascertain that a particular
  knowledge is erroneous : As we have seen, in order to exclude asamyak
  (non-right) knowledge from the sphere of Prama, the term 'Samyak' is inserted
  in the definition of pramana as an epithet of 'anubhava' (apprehension).
  Hence only that means of knowledge is entitled to be called pramana, which
  gives rise to right apprehension, while a means which gives rise to erroneous
  knowledge etc. cannot be called pramana. We have discussed how validity of
  pramana could be ascertained. Here we shall discuss whether the invalidity or
  validity of knowledge could be ascertained at all. In this context one may
  contend that there is nothing which could help us to ascertain that a
  particular knowledge is erroneous. <font class="font5">A question may be
  raised- By what means are we to ascertain the erroneousness of knowledge ?
  This cannot be known by perception, because</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">in that case, the person having erroneous knowledge would not
  be prompted to activity,</font><font class="font0"> as he would be conscious
  of its being erroneous. </font><font class="font5">Nor is it proper to say
  that at the time of the rise of sublation, the erroneous knowledge is
  apprehended by perception, because then it would have become a thing of the
  past.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">A thing of the
  past cannot be apprehended by perception by people like us. And universal
  concomitance (vyapti) cannot be established between a linga or reason in the
  form of the rise of sublation or any like mark and such an utterly
  imperceptible erroneousness.</font><font class="font0"> Vyapti can be formed
  between smoke and fire because they are both capable of being perceived. </font><font
  class="font5">And unless the vyapti be established, inference cannot proceed
  to bring forth any conclusion.</font><font class="font0"> So erroneous
  knowledge cannot be known even by inference. Moreover, in this case, a vyapti
  cannot be formed on the ground of inference which is based upo</font><font
  class="font5">n a general observation. Just as one formulates a vyapti
  between effect and &lt;p.135&gt; agent or the like on the basis of general
  observation.</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, we cannot formulate a
  vyapti between rise of sublation and erroneousness on the ground of inference
  based on general observation. For, if we formulate a vyapti on the ground of
  then there would arise the fault of infinite series. We seek to establish
  vyapti between the rise of sublation and erroneousness so that erroneousness
  could be known by inference. But the formulation of that vyapti is based on
  another inference. </font><font class="font5">Again, this inference would
  require some other vyapti; and the formulation of this vyapti would in turn
  call for another inference. Thus there would be no end.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Hence also the apprehension of the
  non-illusoriness too of knowledge is ruled out.</font><font class="font0">
  That is to say, we have no means to ascertain that a particular cognition is

  <td class=xl65 width=856 style='border-top:none;border-left:none;width:642pt'>Now,
  let us examine these alternatives one by one : <font class="font5">(i) The
  rise of the cognition from non-defective causes cannot be the linga, because
  we have no means to determine that the causes such as visual organ, unseen
  principle (adrsta) etc. are non-defective, as they are super-sensuous.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">And the linga which is itself not
  established cannot help us to establish any probandum.</font><font
  class="font0"> Unless we definitely know that the causes, viz. visual organ
  etc. are non-defective, we cannot say that the cognition brought about by
  these causes is non-erroneous. </font><font class="font5">It is also not true
  to say that the non-defectiveness of the causes (i.e. eyes etc.) can be
  ascertained just on the basis of the particular cognition that has arisen
  from these causes, because it will lead to the fault of mutual dependence.</font><font
  class="font0"> To wit, if a person says that the causes (i.e. eyes etc.) are
  non-defective inasmuch as the cognition that has arisen from those causes is
  non-erroneous, then this will lead to the fault of mutual dependence. That is
  to say, for the ascertainment of the non-erroneousness of cognition one has
  to depend on the non-defectiveness of the causes (i.e. eyes etc.), and for
  the ascertainment of the non-defectiveness of the causes one has to depend
  upon the non-erroneousness of the cognition. This involves the fault of
  mutual dependence, (itaretarasraya). </font><font class="font5">(ii) The
  non-rise of sublation in respect of a particular cognition also cannot be the
  linga that could help us to establish that a particular cognition is
  non-erroneous; since the non-rise of sublation in respect of a cognition is
  possible even on account of other causes. As for example, the person who has
  the cognition may not act in response to that cognition,</font><font
  class="font0"> and due to this also there could be the non-rise of sublation.</font><font
  class="font5"> Or the person may go to some other place or may die</font><font
  class="font0"> without examining his cognition, and because of this also
  there could be the non-rise of sublation. In short, the non-rise of sublation
  cannot &lt;p.137&gt; invariably lead us to ascertain that a cognition is
  non-erroneous. </font><font class="font5">Moreover, non-rise of sublation in
  the case of all persons cannot be determined by persons who are not
  omniscient. Besides, the non-rise of sublatlon on the part of the knower is
  inconclusive, </font><font class="font0">it does not lead to a definite
  conclusion (that the person who has this cognition is not in the wrong); </font><font
  class="font5">since even same persons, are found to remain under illusion for
  a stretch of time (anekakala)</font><font class="font0">, during which the
  sublatlon does not arise, and they feel that they have had right knowledge,
  though in fact they really had wrong knowledge. It happens that after, some
  lapse of time the contradicting knowledge arises and the knower realises that
  he was under illusion. So non-rise of the sublation for some time cannot help
  us to ascertain that a particular cognition was non-erroneous. </font><font
  class="font5">Against this, one may argue that the sublation would never
  arise on the part of a knower in respect of a non-erroneous knowledge. But
  this is not tenable. For, the persons who are not omniscient cannot know that
  in respect of a particular cognition there would never arise the sublation.</font><font
  class="font0"> All this shows that even the non-rise of sublation cannot be a
  linga for ascertaining a cognition as non-erroneous. (iii) Now, let us
  examine the third alternative. </font><font class="font5">The capacity</font><font
  class="font0"> of knowledge </font><font class="font5">to prompt</font><font
  class="font0"> a man </font><font class="font5">to</font><font class="font0">
  successful </font><font class="font5">activity</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">also cannot be</font><font class="font0"> a linga that could
  help us to infer that the knowledge is non-erroneous. </font><font
  class="font5">And the capacity of knowledge to prompt a person to activity is
  characterised by the attainment of a desired thing and the avoidance of an
  undesired one. That capacity of &lt;p.138&gt; knowledge is not known to us.
  And the linga or the reason which is itself not established, cannot lead us
  to any conclusion.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">And
  if</font><font class="font0"> the capacity of knowledge to stimulate a man to
  action </font><font class="font5">be known</font><font class="font0"> to us, </font><font
  class="font5">how could one know that the knowledge of that capacity is
  invariably non-erroneous ? The same alternatives which cannot be evaded will
  present themselves endlessly.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">Moreover in the case of the objects moon and the like, the
  non-erroneousness of the knowledge would not be established</font><font
  class="font0"> by this efficiency of knowledge, which is characterised by the
  attainment of the desired thing, etc; </font><font class="font5">since a
  thing like the moon cannot be reached</font><font class="font0"> ( - of
  course, now in the twentieth century the moon also can be reached by
  astronauts). As Bhasarvajna says we cannot reach the moon and so would never
  definitely know that our cognition of the moon is non-erroneous. </font><font
  class="font5">And even a thing like water which is cognised is not possible
  to attain; because it is being destroyed at every moment by the wind etc. as
  well as by acquatic creatures</font><font class="font0"> through the movement
  in water with their limbs. That is to say, while acquatic creatures like a
  large fish etc. make movement in the water, the water is struck by this and
  hence the action of disjunction in the compounds ending with the binary
  compounds of water starts and water-whole is destroyed. It may be mentioned
  &lt;p.139&gt; here that though Bhasarvajna has mentioned here the causes of
  destruction, such as the wind etc; in the case of water and the like, he
  seems to believe that the body perishes every moment.</font></td>

  But </font><font class="font5">this</font><font class="font0"> argument </font><font
  class="font5">is not tenable</font><font class="font0">, says the
  Tattvopaplavavadin. For, attainment of the thing of the same genus does not
  necessarily enable us to conclude that our cognition was right. This point,
  we find, has been elaborated in the Tattvopaplavasinha of Jayarasi Bhatta.
  There it is said that the genus of water may be present even in the cow or
  the like. And so even when we reach the cow after perceiving water at a
  distance, we would have to accept that our cognition of water was right. And
  as shown in the Tattvopaplavasinha, the absence of waterness in a cow or the
  like cannot reasonably be proved. Thus the attainment of the thing of the
  same genus, being an inconclusive mark &lt;p.140&gt; cannot serve as linga
  for the rightness of cognition. Further, one may urge that on seeing a thing,
  a man is prompted to action and he attains the thing which though not the
  same he has seen, yet is one born in the lineage of that thing. Thus the
  attainment of the thing produced in the lineage (vamsa) of the thing
  perceived can be the linga for the rightness of cognition. But this is not
  proper, says the Tattvopaplavadin. </font><font class="font5">For, in the
  continuum or lineage that which is the last member</font><font class="font0">
  (i.e. the last individual water-substance) </font><font class="font5">cannot
  become generative and so there is no possibility of a thing born in the
  lineage of that thing.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">And
  unless this is proved, we cannot infer that a certain thing is produced in a
  lineage.</font><font class="font0"> The fact that the water I reach is born
  in the lineage of the water I perceived cannot be proved by any inference. </font><font
  class="font5">Thus there are a number of faults in the lingas suggested as
  establishing the non-illuseriness of knowledge.</font><font class="font0">
  All the possible alternatives in regard to the linga have been refuted. </font><font

  class="font5">have been seen; so like the ascertainment of the thing being a
  post or a man</font><font class="font0"> (elsewhere); </font><font
  class="font5">there should be accepted the ascertainment somewhere of
  illusoriness etc.</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, at least one
  should have the awareness of what illusory knowledge is and what non-illusory
  knowledge is; otherwise even doubt would not be possible. Just as only one
  who knows what a post is like and what a man is like, can have a doubt as to
  whether a particular thing is a man or a post.</font><font class="font5">
  Even the Tattvopaplavavadin will have to think out a pramana which could
  possibly establish such</font><font class="font0"> an illusoriness etc. of
  knowledge. </font><font class="font5">For, all investigators are concerned
  with the scrutiny which is based on well-known usage and behaviour. Moreover,
  it is not proper even to point out or express doubt without some pramana
  (proof) for it. The ground on which the doubt is shown is itself a pramana.
  Then how could it be stated that there is no pramana at all? It may be urged
  that the Tattvopaplavavadin only creates doubt in the mind of the other party
  by putting forth a number of alternatives; he does &lt;p.142&gt; not</font><font
  class="font0"> hold that it is really doubt and he does not </font><font
  class="font5">put it forth</font><font class="font0"> as such. </font><font
  class="font5">But this is not proper</font><font class="font0">, says
  Bhasarvajna. </font><font class="font5">For, unless one definitely knows the
  efficiency of alternatives to create doubt, one would not take them up</font><font
  class="font0"> while attempting to create doubt. </font><font class="font5">Unless
  the efficiency of a particular cause is definitely known, indeed it would not
  be proper to take up that cause for a particular effect.</font><font
  class="font0"> If without definitely knowing the efficiency, one employs a
  cause, </font><font class="font5">then there would arise the contingency of
  any cause being taken up for any effect.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">It may be argued that even though there is doubt in regard to</font><font
  class="font0"> the efficiency of </font><font class="font5">threads etc.</font><font
  class="font0"> to produce cloth, a person</font><font class="font5"> is found
  to be taking up</font><font class="font0"> threads etc. </font><font
  class="font5">for a particular effect</font><font class="font0"> (i.e.
  cloth). But </font><font class="font5">this</font><font class="font0"> also </font><font
  class="font5">cannot be maintained. For the capacity of threads or the like
  to bring about a particular effect (cloth etc.) is definitely known. Besides,
  it is an ascertained fact that an effect like cloth cannot be brought about
  in the absence of a cause like threads.</font><font class="font0"> Therefore,
  it is but proper that some specific things are selected for the production of
  particular effects. </font><font class="font5">But the Tattvopaplavavadin
  does not recognise knowledge of the nature of ascertainment in any case, so
  there would be the contingency that in his case no activity would be possible
  or the activity would be just haphazard</font><font class="font0"> (- taking
  up sand, etc. for producing oil and so on). </font><font class="font5">Hence
  he must point out some pramana somewhere, at least to ward off the criticism
  that he himself is talking irrelevantly. And pramana could not be said to be
  'non-ascertained', and its ascertainment is not possible in the absence of
  the ascertainment of the distinction between illusoriness and &lt;p.143&gt;
  non-illusoriness, so there is certainly the ascertainment of illusoriness,

  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Here immediately after the rise of
  knowledge, it is nirvikalpaka pratyaksa (non-determinate perception) that
  should be accepted as cognising or grasping the knowledge qualified by
  erroneousness, etc., otherwise the usage 'This knowledge is erroneous; this
  is non-erroneous' would be baseless.</font><font class="font0"> Bhasarvajna
  seems to hold that the knowledge of erroneousness or of non-erroneousness is
  grasped by the nirvikalpaka pratyaksa, otherwise the usage- ’My knowledge of
  water is non-erroneous' or 'it is erroneous' would be baseless. Thus such a
  usage has its root right in the nirvikalpaka pratyaksa. Here </font><font
  class="font5">one may contend</font><font class="font0"> that if the
  knowledge of erroneousness is grasped by the nirvikalpaka pratyaksa </font><font
  class="font5">the person who wrongly perceives an object would not engage
  himself in activity</font><font class="font0"> inasmuch as he is conscious of
  the erroneousness of his knowledge. </font><font class="font5">But this would
  not happen</font><font class="font0">, says Bhasarvajna. The person would
  certainly do the activity, </font><font class="font5">as he does not become
  distinctly conscious of the erroneousness</font><font class="font0"> of his
  knowledge, </font><font class="font5">just as a man who is running fast does
  not </font><font class="font0">become distinctly conscious</font><font
  class="font5"> of the thorns </font><font class="font0">that are lying on the
  way-side</font><font class="font5"> </font><font class="font0">(though he has
  known them indistinctly in his nirvikalpa pratyaksa). That is to say, the
  grasping of erroneousness remains non-manifest in the nirvikalpa pratyaksa
  and so even the person who has wrongly perceived an object engages himself in
  activity. </font><font class="font5">Indeed it is distinct or manifested
  knowledge whether it be of the nature of memory (smarana) or apprehension
  (anubhava) that is seen to be instrumental in making us desist from a thing
  that is undesirable. Even though the knowledge be not distinct (vyakta) at
  the time of apprehension, the memory arising from such a knowledge may be
  distinct due to some specific instrumental factor. As for example, there is
  the indistinct apprehension of the nature of gotva (cowness) as persisting in
  some and absent in others, when we apprehend the &lt;p.144&gt; first
  individual cow. Then this indistinct apprehension results in distinct memory
  because of the perception of individuals belonging to the same genus and
  others belonging to different genera this memory being of the form 'I have
  seen something like this'. 'Something different from this has been seen by
  me'. 'This is its similarity'. 'This is its difference in character'. Thus
  after the non-distinct apprehension of erroneousness or non-erroneousness (of
  cognition), there arises distinct memory by virtue of the knowledge which
  sublates this or conforms with this.</font><font class="font0"> This distinct
  memory is of the form </font><font class="font5">-'That knowledge was wrong',
  or 'It was right'. </font><font class="font0">That is to say, the
  erroneousness or non-erroneousness of knowledge, though indistinctly
  apprehended, cannot be determined until we have the knowledge that sublates
  our previous knowledge or conforms with it. Here Bhasarvajna gives an
  alternative explanation. He says that just immediately after the rise of
  sublating or conforming knowledge, the erroneousness or non-erroneousness
  would become perceptual. </font><font class="font5">Against this, it may be
  argued that it is not proper to say that the erroneousness or
  non-erroneousness is perceived after the rise of the sublating or conforming
  knowledge, because it would then be a thing of the past and hence it could
  not be the object of perception. But this is not proper,</font><font
  class="font0"> says Bhasarvajna. </font><font class="font5">For the mind can
  perceive objects relating to all the three times, past, present and future.
  Otherwise it would not be possible for a yogin to apprehend things of the
  past and of the future. It may be urged that this could be explained in the
  case of a yogin who can perceive things of the past etc. on the strength of
  his dharma (merit) produced by his yoga.</font><font class="font0"> But this
  is not likely to happen in the case of an ordinary person. </font><font
  class="font5">Against this</font><font class="font0">, Bhasarvajna asks :</font><font
  class="font5"> Is it not justifiably possible even in the case of persons
  like us to perceive some things of the past on the strength of adrsta
  acquired previously, &lt;p.145&gt; accompanied by some specific instrumental
  cause? For, the power of adrsta can be inferred from the effect it brings
  forth.</font></td>

  knowledge. He says that </font><font class="font5">the erroneousness of
  knowledge can be ascertained only by means of inference from the rise of
  sublating knowledge. Against this</font><font class="font0"> a question may
  be raised - </font><font class="font5">By what means does one ascertain the
  invariable concomitance (vyapti)</font><font class="font0"> between the rise
  of sublating knowledge and erroneousness ? The answer is that the invariable
  concomitance can be ascertained </font><font class="font5">by another
  inference</font><font class="font0">. On the strength of the fact that in
  certain cases the association between two things is observed, it is inferred
  that the same association would persist elsewhere also. Thus in fact vyapti
  depends on inference. It may be urged that </font><font class="font5">again
  this inference would in turn require</font><font class="font0"> another
  vyapti, and that too another </font><font class="font5">inference. And this
  &lt;p.146&gt; would involve the fault of infinite series. In answer to this</font><font
  class="font0"> Bhasarvajna boldly asserts that </font><font class="font5">there
  is nothing wrong</font><font class="font0">, even though the alleged fault of
  infinite series be there. On the contrary </font><font class="font5">it is
  welcome, since the samsara (metempsychosis) is itself beginningless.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Hence first the remembrance of
  vyapti would arise from the impressions of another (previous) birth,
  accompanied by adrsta, just as a newly-born child remembers his meal.</font><font
  class="font0"> (The soul must be regarded as eternal because of the desire
  for milk from the mother's breast, which is evinced on birth after death, and
  which can only be due to repeated feeding in the past). </font><font
  class="font5">The opponent may contend here that </font><font class="font0">even
  though the vyapti is admitted to be thus remembered,</font><font class="font5">
  it would be exhausted since it would be necessary to establish a series of
  instances</font><font class="font0"> for the series of vyaptis. </font><font
  class="font5">Consequently </font><font class="font0">the inference based on
  such a weak vyapti</font><font class="font5"> would not be</font><font
  class="font0"> capable</font><font class="font5"> </font><font class="font0">of
  </font><font class="font5">proving what is to be proved.</font><font
  class="font0"> But </font><font class="font5">this</font><font class="font0">
  contention </font><font class="font5">cannot be</font><font class="font0">
  maintained. </font><font class="font5">For, the instance should be taken as
  already established earlier</font><font class="font0"> and hence it is not
  necessary to establish the instance at the time of the inference. </font><font
  class="font5">Indeed no one has to know the relation between smoke and fire
  in places like kitchen (which serve as illustrations) at the time when fire
  is being inferred from smoke.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">It is true that at the time of inference instance is
  necessarily to be established keeping in view the other party.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">But if the opponent</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">refuses to accept</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">it</font><font class="font0"> at
  any stage </font><font class="font5">and</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">differs in all cases</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">then the ascertainment of illusoriness or non-illusoriness
  would not be possible for him;</font><font class="font0"> as this
  ascertainment is based on the illustration. </font><font class="font5">And in
  the absence of ascertainment expressions like ’erroneous knowledge'
  'non-erroneous knowledge' which are well-known in daily life as also in the
  sastras would no longer be possible</font><font class="font0"> - which is
  absurd. </font><font class="font5">For one who denies even the cognition of
  the invariable concomitance between fire and smoke and the like stands
  refuted just by virtue of his contradicting worldly behaviour and usage; and
  not in any other way</font><font class="font0"> (- no other argument is
  necessary). </font><font class="font5">The fact of his contradicting</font><font
  class="font0"> worldly behaviour and usage </font><font class="font5">is
  present in this case also</font><font class="font0"> (when he denies the
  vyapti - wherever there is sublation of knowledge, there is erroneousness). </font><font
  class="font5">&lt;p.147&gt; So it has to be accepted that some illustration
  at some stage would be</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">familiar
  and acceptable</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">to the
  other party and on the strength of it another illustration also would be
  established.</font></td>

  an <font class="font5">alternative suggestion</font><font class="font0"> for
  the ascertainment of the vyapti (concomitance) between the sublation of
  cognition and the erroneousness of the same, Bhasarvajna says </font><font
  class="font5">that</font><font class="font0"> the said </font><font
  class="font5">vyapti</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">is</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">first</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">communicated to some persons who are not as omniscient by
  someone who is able to visualise everything by perception.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Thus from the instruction imparted
  by such a reliable person, ordinary men come to know the vyapti that the
  knowledge which is sublated is illusory, and the knowledge which has another
  knowledge agreeing with it is non-illusory. Then in succession these men
  instruct other about the vyapti and these again in turn do the same and so on
  and on. Thus by succession it reached persons like us.</font><font
  class="font0"> From the view-point of the reliability of vyapti that has
  successively reached us, the said vyapti </font><font class="font5">can be
  compared with the dhatadi-vyapti that is divine in character.</font><font
  class="font0"> This dhatadi-vyapti is related to an ordeal by the scale of a
  balance which according to Dharmasastras indicates the purity (innocence) or
  the impurity (guilt) of a man. The person, accused of some crime has to mount
  a scale and if it goes down on that side, then the person is declared to be
  guilty; otherwise he is declared to be innocent. In this case, the vyapti
  between innocence and the rising of the scale must have been ascertained by
  some great sage. Then by a long line of tradition it came to be known to us
  and it is considered to be acceptable to all. </font><font class="font5">The
  ascertainment of the vyapti even between the effect and the cause by means of
  perception and inference should be justified by this very argument.</font><font
  class="font0"> Thus according to Bhasarvajna, (i) the
  erroneous&lt;p.148&gt;ness or the like of cognition is grasped by
  nirvikalpaka pratyaksa, though it may be indistinctly grasped, and then due
  to the presence of some efficient cause, the non-manifest cognition of erroneousness
  or the like becomes manifest; or (ii) the erroneousness etc. of knowledge
  should be regarded as being perceived after the non-agreement etc. of the
  cognition with practical experience. Or (iii) the erroneousness of knowledge
  can be ascertained by inference, and the vyapti that serves as the basis of
  this inference is ascertained either through the series of inference and
  vyapti or through a reliable tradition. Like the vyapti between the sublation
  of cognition and its erroneousness, the vyapti between the cause and the
  effect also can be ascertained on the same ground.</font></td>

  the knowledge which enables us to attain the water existing in the particular

  where and when it is perceived, is erroneous. Refuting this argument the
  Tattvopaplavavadin may say that if this is admitted, then the knowledge
  produced by a thing that is about to perish should be regarded as vyabhicarin
  ( discrepant or erroneous) because the knowledge will not enable the knower
  to reach the object which will perish immediately. And the knowledge of the
  moon, sun, planets, constellations, stars etc. would have to be regarded as erroneous,
  as the knower will never be able to reach them. Further he says that it is
  also not true to say that the knowledge enables us to attain the water at the
  very time and place when and where it is perceived; because even the place is
  perishable like water. Keeping in mind this argument of the

  Similarly, the word jnana also is used to signify the genus knowledge, i.e.

  cognitions, among which some may be of the nature of ascertainment, while

  class="font5">The answer to this is as follows: The uncertainty attached to
  perception and non-perception is still one more auxiliary cause</font><font
  class="font0"> &lt;p.167&gt; to be added to the causes mentioned above. </font><font
  class="font5">That is to say</font><font class="font0">, the perception or
  non-perception of the nature of ascertainment serves </font><font
  class="font5">as positive (vidhi) or negative (niṣedha) proof</font><font
  class="font0">. But </font><font class="font5">when there is uncertainty</font><font
  class="font0"> in perception or in non-perception,</font><font class="font5">
  there arises a doubt</font><font class="font0">. For example, when a man
  perceives his beloved at a distance, sees some common property as found in
  all women and when he expects to know some particular feature, he does not
  have a doubt; because he perceives the positive or negative indicative and
  thereby decides that the woman he perceives at a distance is certainly his
  beloved. But when his perception itself is of the nature of non-ascertainment
  or when there is uncertainty in his perception, he would certainly have a
  doubt. </font><font class="font5">This shows that uncertainty in perception
  or in non-perception is an indispensable auxiliary cause of doubt in addition
  to</font><font class="font0"> the perception of common property and </font><font
  class="font5">the expectancy for the knowledge of some particular feature.</font><font
  class="font0"> Thus the perception of a common property is the particular
  cause of the first kind of doubt, while the expectancy for the knowledge of
  particular feature and the uncertainty in perception or non-perception are
  auxiliary causes of the doubt. Showing the importance of the expectancy for
  the knowledge of a particular feature, as an auxiliary cause of doubt,
  Bhasarvajna says that a man, </font><font class="font5">while quickly passing
  through a wood of Panasa and other trees, perceives the common property of
  trees</font><font class="font0">; and there is uncertainty in his perception
  or non-perception, </font><font class="font5">he does not know for certain of</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">the presence of positive or
  negative indicatives</font><font class="font0"> which could enable him to
  arrive at a decision as to whether the tree he sees is a Panasa tree or
  another one. </font><font class="font5">Still he does not have any doubt,
  because he does not desire to know the particular feature</font><font
  class="font0"> by which he can distinguish a Panasa tree from others. That is
  to say, he is not interested in the identity of the trees and he does not
  wish to differentiate between one tree and another and so a doubt viz.
  &quot;Is this Panasa or some other tree?&quot; does not arise. </font><font
  class="font5">Therefore, it is concluded that the perception of a common
  property, accompanied by all the auxiliary causes constitutes the cause of</font><font
  class="font0"> the first kind of </font><font class="font5">doubt.</font></td>
  <td class=xl69 width=235 style='border-top:none;border-left:none;width:176pt'>Translation
  is overall rather loose. Also: &quot;Is this Panasa or some other tree?&quot;

  class="font5">Some try to solve this difficulty as follows:</font><font
  class="font0"> They say that </font><font class="font5">it is not correct to
  say that we cannot perceive an uncommon or peculiar property as accompanied
  by particulars that are contradictory to each other;</font><font class="font0">
  </font><font class="font5">since we see a particular in both ways, in the
  case of the entities of the same class</font><font class="font0"> (e.g.
  eternal) </font><font class="font5">as well as in those of the class other
  than that</font><font class="font0"> (e.g. non-eternal) - in homogeneous
  things as well as in heterogeneous ones. </font><font class="font5">That is
  to say, when by 'things' belonging to the same class non-eternal things are
  meant, then by 'the things other than these' the eternal ones are meant. For
  example, in homogeneous things like jar etc. resides the particular, i.e.
  jarness etc.; in heterogeneous things e.g., soul and the like, resides the
  particular, i.e. soulness and the like. Thus, jarness etc. are known, by
  means of the sources of knowledge, as accompanied by non-eternality; on the
  other hand, soulness etc. are also known by means of sources of knowledge as
  accompanied by eternality. In this way, the particular feature viz. jarness
  or soulness, is found as accompanied in both ways, viz. by eternality as well
  as by non-eternality.</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, ghaṭatva and
  ātmatva, though particular, can co-exist with anityatva and nityatva,
  respectively, and no invariable concomitance of particular can be established
  with either eternality or non-eternality. </font><font class="font5">And
  there is this specific property or viśeṣa in śabda, viz. audibility
  (śrāvaṇatva) and its being the specific attribute of ākāśa
  (ākāśa-viśeṣa-guṇatva), so the doubt arises, 'Is this the viśeṣa of śabda
  which is eternal or of śabda which is non-eternal?'</font><font class="font0">
  It may be noted that Bhasarvajna has regarded śabda itself as a viśeṣa
  (specific property) of ākāśa, as it is not found elsewhere. This peculiarity
  of śabda gives rise to doubt. On the other hand, according to the view held
  by the section of thinkers referred to here, the state of being the object of
  auditory organ (śrāvaṇatva) and the state of being the peculiar property of
  ākāśa (ākāśaviśeṣaguṇatva) constitute the viśeṣa of śabda, which leads us to
  doubt whether śabda is eternal or not.</font></td>

  The character of being excluded, or of being distinct, from eternal things is

  non-eternal things is found in eternal things only. But this, sabda, about we
  are discussing, is distinct from both eternal and non-eternal things by

  this, Bhasarvajna comes to treat the last two varieties of doubt. When a man
  perceives something like water at a distance in sunshine, he has a doubt as
  to whether it is real water or a mirage. On the other hand, when a man does
  not perceive a goblin (piśāca), there arises a doubt - 'Does the goblin
  really exist but is not perceived or does it not really exist and so is not
  perceived?' Commenting on this in the Nyayabhusana Bhasarvajna says that <font
  class="font5">the cognition which proceeds positively is 'upalabdhi'
  (apprehension</font><font class="font0">, e.g. a man positively perceives
  something before he has a doubt in respect of water); </font><font
  class="font5">and the cognition which proceeds negatively and so also
  non-rise of cognition are called an-upalabdhi (non-apprehension</font><font
  class="font0">, to wit, a man has the knowledge ’There is no goblin' or does
  not perceive a goblin and entertains a doubt about its existence). Here
  Bhasarvajna specifically draws our attention to the fact that apprehension
  (upalabdhi) and non-apprehension (an-upalabdhi) </font><font class="font5">are
  separate causes of doubt as well as epithets of uncertainty (avyavasthā</font><font
  class="font0">, viz. upalabdhi-avyavasthā, anupalabdhi-avyavasthā). </font><font
  class="font5">This being the case, </font><font class="font0">the Nyaya-sutra
  (1.1.23) giving the definition of doubt </font><font class="font5">should be
  taken as a collection of five sub-sutras, one for each definition.</font><font
  class="font0"> The uncertainty in perception &lt;p.179&gt; and in
  non-perception should be taken as an auxiliary cause common to all kinds of
  doubt and so it should be associated with the particular cause of each kind
  of doubt.</font></td>

  is a controversy regarding the number of doubts. Vatsyayana derives the five
  kinds of doubt from this Nyaya-sutra. He takes uncertainty in apprehension
  and uncertainty in non-apprehension as separate causes of doubt. Thus in his
  view a doubt arises from the apprehension of common property (samāna-dharma),
  the apprehension of peculiar property (aneka-dharma) from contradictory
  views, from uncertainty of apprehension and from uncertainty of
  non-apprehension. Against this view, Uddyotakara accepts only the first three
  types of doubt taking the other words, viz. uncertainty of apprehension and
  of non-apprehension, as epithets of other terms given in the Nyayasutra. Thus
  he derives three types of doubt from the Nyayasutra. Supporting the view of
  Uddyotakara, Vācaspati Miśra recognises only three kinds of doubt. However,
  BSJ accepts five types of doubt, supp&lt;p.180&gt;orting the view of

  of common property</font><font class="font0">, which is the cause of the

  admitted as arising in respect of an object of apprehension or of
  non-apprehension, as to whether the object that is perceived or non-perceived
  really exists or not; then the state of being apprehended in the case of
  apprehension of something becomes a property common to two things,</font><font
  class="font0"> viz. water and mirage; so this does not differ from the cause
  of the first type of doubt, i.e. the apprehension of a property common to two
  things. Similarly the state of being non-apprehended in the case of
  non-apprehension of something becomes a property common to two things, viz.
  the existence of goblin and the non-existence of goblin. Thus apprehension
  and non-apprehension as causes of doubt do not virtually differ from the
  cause of doubt, viz. the perception of common property. The answer to this is
  that the two cases are different. In the case of common property -
  'samāna-dharma' we do not doubt the existence of the thing that is cognised;
  we only have a doubt whether it is a post or a man. While here we have
  &lt;p.181&gt; a doubt whether the thing which is apprehended as water is
  existent or not; or whether the thing (ghost) which is not apprehended is
  really non-existent or is existent. But this explanation also is not tenable,
  says the contender. Against this, </font><font class="font5">it may be argued
  further that</font><font class="font0"> in spite of that difference in the
  two cases, apprehension and non-apprehension as causes of doubt do not differ
  from the perception of common property. For, </font><font class="font5">the

  (i) Internal and (ii) External. The former is thus illustrated: When some of
  the predictions declared come to be true, while others false, the foreteller,
  while declaring the next prediction, entertains a doubt - 'Will it come true
  or false?' Then the external doubt is further divided into two kinds: (A) In
  respect of a thing perceived; e.g. on seeing a tall thing one may havs a
  doubt-'Is it a man or a post?' (B) In respect of a thing that is not
  perceived, e.g., on seeing only horns, a man passing through a forest
  entertains a doubt as to whether it is a cow or a gavaya. Thus we find that

  of Conjecture (Uha) and Indefinite apprehension ( anadhyavasaya) from Doubt :
  <font class="font5">As said before, doubt and illusion are excluded</font><font
  class="font0"> from true apprehension </font><font class="font5">by inserting
  the word 'Samyak'</font><font class="font0"> in the general definition of
  pramana given in the Nyayasara. Here </font><font class="font5">the question
  arises - By what can one exclude conjecture and indefinite apprehension</font><font
  class="font0"> from the sphere of true knowledge ? </font><font class="font5">In
  answer to this question, Bhasarvajna says</font><font class="font0"> in the
  Nyayasara </font><font class="font5">that since non-determination</font><font
  class="font0"> ( anavadharanatva) is common to doubt on the one hand and </font><font
  class="font5">conjecture</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">as
  well as indefinite apprehensio</font><font class="font0">n on the other, the
  latter two </font><font class="font5">are not essentially different from
  doubt. And so just by excluding doubt from the sphere of true knowledge,
  Bhasarvajna has tacitly denied conjecture and indefinite cognition</font><font
  class="font0"> (- which are of the same nature as doubt) </font><font
  class="font5">as the fruit of the means of right knowledge. Similarly the
  author of the Nyaya-sutra has inserted the word 'vyavasayatmaka'</font><font
  class="font0"> (well-defined, of the nature of determination) </font><font
  class="font5">in the definition of perception in order to exclude doubt; but
  he has remarkably not inserted any other word to exclude conjecture and
  indefinite cognition. It may be argued that doubt depends on the two objects
  alternately,</font><font class="font0"> that is to say, in the state of doubt
  the mind oscillates between two objects alternately - 'might it be a man or a
  post ?' thus doubt has as its basis two objects alternately, </font><font
  class="font5">whereas conjecture and indefinite cognition are altogether
  different from doubt. So how could the former not be essentially different
  from the latter ? In reply to this Bhasarvajna says that this is not proper.
  For, conjecture and indefinite apprehension are covered &lt;p.185&gt; by the
  same definition. And simply because they have certain sub-variations, they
  cannot be regarded as altogether different from doubt.</font><font
  class="font0"> For example, it is not justifiable if one regards a stone as
  an altogether different category from earth, only because the stone is
  different from clay. Though in common parlance, the use of the word 'Prthivi'
  is restricted to a particular part of the earth, yet in the scientific texts
  stone, etc. also are accepted as 'Prthivi' as it commonly possesses the
  distinctive characteristic, odour. Similarly since conjecture and indefinite
  apprehension commonly possess the characteristic of non-determination they
  are admitted as doubt. An objection may be raised here that if on the ground
  of having a common characteristic, i.e. non-determination, conjecture and
  indefinite cognition are recognised as one with the doubt, </font><font
  class="font5">then there would arise the contingency of perception, inference
  etc. being admitted as one on account of their having a common
  characteristic, i.e. being the means of valid knowledge.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">This is not a fault, says
  Bhasarvajna, because</font><font class="font0"> pramana has been accepted as
  one category. </font><font class="font5">The division of pramana is only one
  and perception etc. are its sub-divisions. It is not that the cause of
  designating a means of right know ledge as 'perception’ is present in
  inference etc. also; or the cause of designating a means of right knowledge as
  ’inference’ is present in other pramanas also;</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">so that this usage - different designations for the
  sub-varieties, would come to an end.</font><font class="font0"> That is to
  say, perception, inference etc. have this in common that they are all means
  of valid knowledge and so are classified as pramana. But over and above this,
  perception (source of valid perceptual knowledge) has some distinctive
  characteristic which is not present in inference (means of valid inferential
  knowledge) etc. and so it alone is called pratyaksa-pramana. This is true of
  anumana-pramana etc. also. </font><font class="font5">This argument also
  refutes the view that inference and verbal testimony are one in asmuch as
  they are alike the means of indirect apprehension. And it is not that the
  cause of designating some knowledge as doubt, viz. non-determination, is not
  present in conjecture (Uha) etc.</font><font class="font0"> It is,
  there&lt;p.186&gt;fore concluded that conjecture (Uha) and indefinite

  Nyayakandali may be noted as follows : When a king known to a man passes by,
  the man whose mind was pre-occupied or who is desirious of attaining the
  knowledge of some particular may have an indefinite apprehension : Some one
  passed by along this way. This is anadhyavasya. Or when a man who
  &lt;p.187&gt; has not known Panasa tree sees that tree, he would feel like
  asking- ’What might this tree be called ?' This indefinite knowledge in
  respect of the tree is anadbyavasaya. Thus in the school anadhyavasaya has
  been regarded as distinct from samsaya, while in Bhasarvajna's view, inasmuch
  as the attribute of non-determination (anavadharanatva) is common to Uha and
  anadhyavasaya on the one hand and to samsaya on the other, the former are not
  essentially different from the latter.</td>

  conjecture is an intermediate cognition between doubt and determination,
  which is of the nature of guess or surmise, e.g. 'It must be a man in the

  doubt. It may be urged that conjecture cannot be one with doubt, as it is not

  proof : nor is it ascertainment (nirnaya) because conjecture arises even when
  there is no positive proof. Knowledge of the nature of ascertainment cannot

  answers these arguments as follows : <font class="font5">As for the
  opponent's contention that doubt is always of the nature of alternatives, it
  is not right, because doubt is found</font><font class="font0"> arising </font><font
  class="font5">otherwise also;</font><font class="font0"> that is to say,
  without the oscillation between two alternatives. </font><font class="font5">For
  example, a man who has already known the particular result or effect
  entertains a doubt in regard to the particular means or cause that could
  bring about that result or effect - 'What could be the particular means to
  bring about this result ?' Or a man who having ascertained that whosoever is
  born is sure to die, entertains a doubt as he does not know the particular
  time of his death - &quot;When shall I die ?&quot;</font><font class="font0">
  </font><font class="font5">Here though the alternatives like</font><font
  class="font0"> 'Shall I die </font><font class="font5">today or to-morrow ?'
  etc. are not explicity experienced in such doubts, they are certainly implied
  therein.</font><font class="font0"> This clearly shows that explicit
  alternatives are by no means indispensable in doubt. Bhasarvajna who asserts
  that conjecture (Uha) is not essentially different from doubt says that </font><font
  class="font5">similarly</font><font class="font0"> in the case of conjecture </font><font
  class="font5">one may feel - 'It must be a man' , since one finds there
  abundance of positive proofs for the probability of being a man. Or what one
  sees in the stable might be something other than man, also; in as much as the
  absence of all other possible alternatives is not ascertained. And if it were
  so ascertained, it would come to be ascertained knowledge (nirnaya)</font><font
  class="font0"> and it no longer remains conjecture. </font><font class="font5">That
  is to say, when all other alternatives are absent, the tallness becomes a
  distinctive characteristic of man - on seeing a tall object one may feel -
  'it must be a man.' Other examples of conjecture may be noted as follows: On
  seeing a particular field one thinks - When the field is full of crop the
  owner of the field is expected to be there, in order to guard the crop. Or on
  seeing a particular house-holder one makes a conjecture-'meal is likely to be
  obtained here.' In all such examples the absence of other probable
  alternatives is not ascertained.</font><font class="font0"> Hence in
  conjecture &lt;p.189&gt; we do not have an ascertained knowledge of a thing. </font><font
  class="font5">The cognition that arises in such cases is found to be of the
  nature of probability (bhavitavyatmaka pratyaya).</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">It may be argued: 'Conjecture is different from doubt, because
  it arises after doubt, like determination'- Here if the reason</font><font
  class="font0"> 'because it arises after doubt' </font><font class="font5">is
  stated with reference to the whole class of conjecture, then </font><font
  class="font0">the probandum is not different from that which the Naiyayika
  has accepted, </font><font class="font5">as conjecture is accepted as a
  particular type of doubt.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">The reason</font><font class="font0"> 'on account of its
  arising after the rise of doubt' </font><font class="font5">is not distinct
  from the probandum</font><font class="font0"> - something which is yet to be
  proved. In the above reason it is taken for granted that conjecture is
  something which is different from doubt and it arises after the rise of
  doubt. But this is what is yet to be proved. Bhāsarvajna seems to emphasise
  the point that if Conjecture is sought to be proved as a (sub) class of
  doubt, then that probandum is in no way different from the accepted one,
  because conjecture is recognised as a particular kind of doubt. </font><font
  class="font5">On the other hand, if the above reason is stated keeping in
  view an individual case, then that reason would be inconclusive (
  anaikantika) . For a doubt also arises after an individual case of doubt.</font><font
  class="font0"> But it does by no means prove that the two doubts belong to
  different classes. Again, </font><font class="font5">it may be urged</font><font
  class="font0"> that conjecture ( Uha or Tarka) is different from doubt </font><font
  class="font5">because they are separately mentioned</font><font class="font0">
  in the Nyayasutra. But </font><font class="font5">this reason also is
  discrepant since</font><font class="font0"> it co-exists even with the
  absence of sadhya. For example, </font><font class="font5">the members of
  syllogism, pratijna. hetu etc. though not being different from pramana, are
  mentioned separately from pramana</font><font class="font0">. </font><font
  class="font5">Similarly hetvabhasas or fallacies of reason, though being
  subsumed in Nigrahasthana ( ground of defeat)</font><font class="font0">, are
  mentioned separately from Nigrahasthana in the first Nyayasutra. Thus the
  separate mention of samsaya and Tarka or Uha in the first Nyayasutra does not
  prove that they are different from each other. It may be contended that if
  the catego&lt;p.190&gt;ries such as samsaya, Tarka etc. are not really
  different from each other, they ought not to have been mentioned separately
  from each other </font><font class="font5">in the Nyayasutra</font><font
  class="font0">. There is an apparent contradiction in such a treatment.
  Bhasarvajna answers that </font><font class="font5">there is no</font><font
  class="font0"> such </font><font class="font5">contradiction</font><font
  class="font0">, </font><font class="font5">since the separate mention</font><font
  class="font0"> of some non-different categories (e. g. pramana and avayava,
  samsaya and Tarka-Uha, hetvabhasa and nigrahasthana) </font><font
  class="font5">has been made</font><font class="font0"> in the Nyayasutra </font><font
  class="font5">with a special purpose</font><font class="font0">. </font><font
  class="font5">The purpose of doubt in general is to provoke the Nyaya
  (syllogism).</font><font class="font0"> Quoting the words of Vatsyayana
  Bhasarvajna says that </font><font class="font5">Nyaya or Reasoning functions
  neither with regard to things unknown nor with regard to those known
  definitely it functions only with regard to things that are doubtful.</font></td>

  may be argued here that <font class="font5">if it is insisted that Nyaya
  functions exclusively with regard to those things which are doubtful (
  sandigdhe eva arthe), then it is not justifiable. For, Nyaya ( inferential
  syllogism) is found to function even in respect of things that are not
  doubtful. For example, neither the proponent (vadin) nor the opponent
  (prativadin) has any doubt about the topic they discuss; still they employ
  Nyaya (syllogistic method of argument) while advancing arguments.</font><font
  class="font0"> This clearly shows that even in the absence of doubt, Nyaya
  could function. </font><font class="font5">Against this, it may be argued
  that the above rule</font><font class="font0"> (that Nyaya functions only in
  regard &lt;p.191&gt; to those things that are doubtful) </font><font
  class="font5">is applicable only to the inference for one's own self.</font><font
  class="font0"> That is to say, before a man employs Nyaya in order to have an
  inferential knowledge for himself, he certainly entertains a doubt. </font><font
  class="font5">But this also is far from the truth.</font><font class="font0">
  </font><font class="font5">For, a man, wandering </font><font class="font0">from
  one </font><font class="font5">forest </font><font class="font0">to another </font><font
  class="font5">with some other purpose, proceeds to make an inference </font><font
  class="font0">about fire or the like</font><font class="font5"> on the
  strength of smoke or the like,</font><font class="font0"> though he does not
  have any doubt with regard to the presence of fire. Hence it is obvious that
  even in the case of inference for one's own self, anumana is found to
  function in the absence of doubt. </font><font class="font5">On the other
  hand if it is said that Nyaya functions invariably in all cases of doubt also
  (sandigdhe apy arthe pravartate eva); we can say that that also is not
  possible. For, Nyaya is sometimes found not to operate even in the presence
  of doubt, due to the absence of desire</font><font class="font0"> (to have
  decisive knowledge regarding the object) </font><font class="font5">or due to
  some such other factor.</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, the man is
  not interested in the presence or absence of the things, though the doubt may
  have occurred to him, and so he does not indulge in Nyaya. </font><font

  of the functioning of Nyaya.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></font></td>

  answer to this argument Bhasarvajna says that the words 'samsayite eva arthe'
  <font class="font5">cannot be</font><font class="font0"> interpreted as
  above. It should be interpreted thus. </font><font class="font5">It is in
  view of the fitness</font><font class="font0"> for being an object of doubt, </font><font
  class="font5">that </font><font class="font0">the restriction (signified by
  the word 'eva') is accepted and in the light of this </font><font
  class="font5">the first restriction is accepted</font><font class="font0">,
  viz. it functions only in respect of a thing about which there is doubt. The
  word 'eva' in &quot;Samsayite eva 'rthe&quot; (only in respect of a thing
  about which there is a doubt) signifies avadhāraṇa (restriction) in view of
  yogyata ( capability or fitness for being an object of doubt). </font><font
  class="font5">This is what is desired to be expressed by the statement.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">This fitness consists in the
  apprehension</font><font class="font0"> of an object </font><font
  class="font5">in general, accompanied by the uncertainty about its
  particulars and consists in the difference of opinion in discussions, etc.
  This being the case it does not entail that like doubt, illusion (Viparyaya)
  also should be separately mentioned in the Nyayasutra &lt;p.192&gt; though it
  is implicitly comprehended by the terms pramana, prameya, etc.</font><font
  class="font0"> The reason for not mentioning illusion separately in the
  Nyayasutra is that it does not </font><font class="font5">provoke one to
  thought</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">or reasoning</font><font
  class="font0">, while doubt certainly does so. </font><font class="font5">When
  a thing has been ascertained by erroneous knowledge</font><font class="font0">
  (which is certain knowledge, though it is wrong), </font><font class="font5">hetu
  (reason) does not become a right means of knowledge in respect of it.</font><font
  class="font0"> Thus Viparyaya (error) unlike Samsaya (doubt) does not provoke
  one to thought or reasoning. </font><font class="font5">Besides, a man is
  found to be trying to remove doubt but one never sees him trying to remove
  illusion (viparyaya). And when a debater or proponent tries to remove the
  error or wrong belief of his opponent, he employs the syllogistic argument
  (Nyaya) with a view to removing the difference of opinion in order to
  strengthen his own ascertained view or instil the sense of firm determination
  among his pupils. This Nyaya is meant for</font><font class="font0"> (the
  removal of ) </font><font class="font5">the doubt which is</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">the subject of the difference of
  opinion;</font><font class="font0"> because two parties have two positive but
  contrary cognitions in respect of the same thing. So there is bound to be
  doubt and syllogistic arguments are meant to remove this doubt. </font><font
  class="font5">Hence the author of the Nyayasutra has mentioned Sandeha or
  Samsaya separately as it is a supplementary factor of thought or
  ratiocination</font><font class="font0">. </font><font class="font5">It is,
  therefore, quite justifiable that the purpose of doubt is to cause Nyaya or
  syllogistic argument to function or to provoke it.<span

  class="font5">Now a question may be raised : What is the purpose behind
  mentioning tarka or Uha separately in the Nyayasutra, though it is included
  in doubt ? The answer to this is that the purpose of conjecture or tarka is
  to render help to the pramanas.</font><font class="font0"> In support of his
  view Bhasarvajna quotes </font><font class="font5">a statement of</font><font
  class="font0"> some unknown </font><font class="font5">earlier acarya</font><font
  class="font0">, which </font><font class="font5">runs thus : In respect of
  the &lt;p.193&gt; subject which has been critically analysed by tarka,
  pramanas proceed to function.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">In this manner pramanas are helped by tarka.</font><font
  class="font0"> Expressing his own view in this regard </font><font
  class="font5">Bhasarvajna says that tarka has been separately mentioned in
  the Nyayasutra in order to</font><font class="font0"> clarify its purpose,
  viz. to </font><font class="font5">qualify the functioning of discussion
  (vada) etc. </font><font class="font0">Thus in Bhasarvajna's view tarka or
  Uha becomes useful in debate etc. and it is mentioned in their context. In
  this regard </font><font class="font5">some hold that a Naiyayika should not
  engage himself in discussion etc. The reason is that no rational being starts
  any activity without being certain. And in debate etc. there is no such
  certainty beforehand that by such and such a refutatory argument or
  demonstrative argument he would be able to defeat the opponent or to
  enlighten him, since the intention of another is always difficult to judge.</font><font
  class="font0"> He does not know what counter-arguments the opponent would put
  forth and so also what he would have to say in answer to these. Not to talk
  of opponents, the intellectual capacity of even a pupil is difficult to
  assess.</font><font class="font5"> It is seen that a pupil who is given
  instruction by a teacher does not sometimes understand the concepts properly
  or he understands them otherwise, even though his intellectual capacity had
  been assessed by the teacher over a long period.</font><font class="font0">
  In short, in a &lt;p.194&gt; debate it is very difficult to judge how the
  opponent would respond to the argument. </font><font class="font5">And
  sometimes even the teacher is seen to be silenced</font><font class="font0">
  by his disciple. </font><font class="font5">For this reason, though tarka may
  be useful for one's own conviction, yet it does not invariably bring about
  the desired result and since the means for convincing others of the truth are
  not ascertained, tarka cannot possibly be employed in discussion etc. and so
  the knowledge of tarka for vada etc. is useless.</font><font class="font0">
  Bhasarvajna says that </font><font class="font5">against such a stand</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">the author of the Nyaya-sutra has
  enumerated tarka separately and defined it and established tarka as a means
  of participating in discussion etc.</font><font class="font0"> It is laid
  down in the Nyayasutra- </font><font class="font5">&quot;</font><font
  class="font0">Discussion consists in the putting forward (by two persons) of
  a thesis and a counter-thesis, </font><font class="font5">in which there is
  supporting and condemning by means of proofs and reasonings,</font><font
  class="font0"> neither of which is quite opposed to the main doctrine ( or
  thesis), and both of which are carried on in full accordance with the method
  of reasoning through the five factors&quot;. </font><font class="font5">What
  is meant here is this - In a discussion etc. a Naiyayika should be capable of
  putting forth the supporting (establishment) and the condemning (demolition)
  that are ascertained through pramana or are subjected to the test of tarka,
  as causes of one's own victory and of the opponent's defeat. When a man
  proceeds to put forth arguments after having ascertained the matter with the
  help of a pramana (source of valid knowledge), then he certainly achieves his
  end</font><font class="font0"> (his own victory and the opponent's defeat). </font><font
  class="font5">When in the absence of decisive knowledge, he simply
  anticipates the possibility of the desired end on the basis of the causes</font><font
  class="font0"> (i.e. reasoning which indicates the presence of proof -
  showing the absurdity of a contrary &lt;p.195&gt; conclusion - Karanopattitah
  ), </font><font class="font5">even then he does attain his end.</font><font
  class="font0"> It cannot be said that even a means of one's conviction could
  at times be discrepant, i.e. fail to prove the point. </font><font
  class="font5">If it is</font><font class="font0"> found to be </font><font
  class="font5">discrepant</font><font class="font0">, </font><font
  class="font5">it could be only according to the maxim of kakataliya-nyaya</font><font
  class="font0">. That is to say, the failure must be due to some other cause
  and it is just a coincidence that the failure occurs simultaneously with the
  attainment of the knowledge of certain victory or its probability. Normally a
  man fully conversant with the rules of discussion (vada) etc., certainly
  becomes successful. And it happens though rarely, that such a person is
  defeated. In the case of his defeat, the presence of the knowledge of vada
  etc. and the defeat are accidentally simultaneous. They are not connected by
  a causal relation; just as the sitting of a crow and the falling of a fruit
  of palmyra tree have no causal relation. Normally one does attain the desired
  end, </font><font class="font5">just as a weaver working on threads does get
  cloth</font><font class="font0">. </font><font class="font5">Hence a
  Naiyiyika should not proceed to indulge in a debate, though he is challenged
  or called to a dispute by his opponent, until and unless he has ascertained
  fully his own capacity of the form of excellence in knowledge etc; and as
  against this, the weakness of the opponent and also the capacity of the
  president and the judges to prevent unjust proceedings in the &lt;p.196&gt;
  council and their quality of impartiality.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">And he who proceeds to debate merely on account of his ego,
  without having given due consideration to his own capability; is not a
  Naiyayika - a rational being, because he does not examine rationally. Indeed,
  an intelligent person does not start eating food, though he is very hungry,
  without dispelling the doubt about the food being poisonous.</font></td>

  class="font5">It may be contended here that doubt about the desired end</font><font
  class="font0"> (- it is as likely that he will succeed as it is that he will
  fail -) </font><font class="font5">becomes a cause of activity</font><font
  class="font0">; viz. doubt also inspires a man to act. </font><font
  class="font5">Analysing and elaborating the opponent's contention Bhasarvajna
  says that it means that all the three, viz. doubt, conjecture and certainty
  regarding what is not desired</font><font class="font0"> (i.e. failure) </font><font
  class="font5">are causes which prevent a man from activity.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Similarly doubt, conjecture and
  certainty regarding the desired end (i.e. success) could be the causes of
  activity</font><font class="font0">; viz. they provoke a man to act. </font><font
  class="font5">Then, why could doubt not serve as a cause of activity in
  respect of debate etc. ?</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">To
  this Bhasarvajna's answer is that it is not so. </font><font class="font0">For,
  a doubt that desired end is likely to be acheived cannot serve as a cause of
  activity, </font><font class="font5">because doubt of the likelihood of
  achieving the desired end provokes a man to activity differently</font><font
  class="font0">. </font><font class="font5">For example, when a man suffering
  from an ailment does not find a sure remedy for its removal,</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">he</font><font class="font0"> being
  doubtful about various medicines </font><font class="font5">starts</font><font
  class="font0"> taking a particular medicine </font><font class="font5">even
  with a doubt about the desired result</font><font class="font0">. </font><font
  class="font5">And</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">the
  ailment of the man who thus starts</font><font class="font0"> taking some
  such medicine </font><font class="font5">might at times be cured</font><font
  class="font0">. </font><font class="font5">But conversely if a man does not
  start</font><font class="font0"> taking a medicine at all, </font><font
  class="font5">his ailment would remain as it was.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">When a man has a doubt that certain factors could possibly be
  the cause of his desired end, and does not see any other cause of his desired
  end, or does not see the likelihood of there being too much effort required
  or does not see the likelihood of anything untoward happening in it, then he
  proceeds to act being provoked to do so even by the very doubt regarding the
  desired end</font><font class="font0"> (- that it is as likely that he will
  succeed as it is that he will fail). </font><font class="font5">Thus even a
  doubt about the achievement of something desired serves as a cause of
  activity in &lt;p.197&gt; respect of a rational being. But this cannot be
  compared with</font><font class="font0"> the activity of </font><font
  class="font5">a gambler</font><font class="font0"> who starts throwing dice
  without having any prior consideration about gain or loss. </font><font
  class="font5">But if a man engages himself in disputation and wrangling
  without consideration, he would be defeated and so he has to endure a great
  loss, while a man not thus engaging himself in disputation has not to lose
  anything. Hence a rational man should not take initiative in participating
  even in vada (discussion) on account of doubt</font><font class="font0"> ( of
  the likelihood of success). </font><font class="font5">And if a man employs
  fallacious reasons etc; there would arise the contingency of his statements
  being neglected as falling within the range of dull intellect. Moreover, a
  man who enters into discussion with his teacher in order to determine his own
  capability of putting forth valid reasons etc. of which he is not initially
  certain, should be considered as just a pupil, because he aims at the
  acquirement of knowledge; like one who is engaged in the examination of the
  meaning of the scriptural text. He should not be regarded as a debater or
  dialectician proper. Thus it is concluded that tarka though included in
  doubt, has been separately mentioned in the Nyayasutra in view of its special
  contribution in the proceedings of discussion etc. </font><font class="font0">Here
  it may be noted that with a slight digression Bhasarvajna has sought to
  elucidate the special significance of Samsaya and Uha or tarka in the
  functioning of vada etc. and shown that they are not essentially different
  from each other in as much as the characteristic of non-determination is
  common to both of them.</font></td>

  of Anadhyavasaya (Indefinite apprehension) Under Doubt : <font class="font5">Indefinite
  apprehension such as, 'What could be the name of this tree ?' does not
  substantially differ from doubt.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">An object whose generic name is 'vrksa' (tree) is indeed found
  to have another name also</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">such as a mango (tree) etc. Thus a man who has known the
  generic name of an object, e.g. 'a tree', infers that the object should have
  a distinctive particular name &lt;p.198&gt; also e.g. a mango tree. Thus on
  the ground of genus, a man tries to recollect the distinctive particular name
  of the tree he perceives, and entertains a doubt - 'What could be the name of
  this tree ?' In doubt the specific names find mention, e.g. 'Is it a post or
  a man?' In contrast to this, in indefinite apprehension no specific name
  finds mention, since in that case there are numerous types of names, some
  known, some unknown. For example, a man who possesses a thousand cows and who
  also knows their particular names such as Bhadra, Nanda etc. is informed that
  one of his cows has delivered a calf. On hearing this he entertains a doubt
  just in the form. 'Which cow could have delivered a calf ?' He does not
  resort to particular alternatives like 'Could it be Bhadra?' 'Could it be
  Nanda?' and so on. The indefinite apprehension (anadhyavasaya) arises when a
  man who makes arrows etc. (i.e. carpenter) being very busy &lt;p.199&gt; and
  since he is not interested in this (- type of tree) may just by the way ask
  such a question : 'What might be the name of this tree ?' That also should be
  taken as included in doubt by the above exposition. Even in the case of the
  doubt, regarding post etc. a notion to the effect -'We do not know what it
  is' occurs to the mind in between the perception of the thing and the actual
  form of the doubt, 'Is it a man or a post ?'</font><font class="font0"> The
  occurrence of such a notion is common to both, doubt and indefinite
  apprehension. </font><font class="font5">Hence merely on the basis of a minor
  internal variation in form indefinite apprehensions ( anadhyavasaya) cannot
  be said to be altogether different </font><font class="font0">from doubt</font><font
  class="font5"> </font><font class="font0">since both have the same
  characteristic of non-determinations. We should bear in mind that though</font><font
  class="font5"> nirvikalpaka (non-determinate cognition) and savikalpaka
  (determinate cognition) perceptions have some minor distinctive
  characteristics</font><font class="font0"> (sub-differences), yet they are
  regarded as one i.e. perception; </font><font class="font5">on account of
  their having the same essential characteristic</font><font class="font0">,
  viz. the rising from the contact of sense-organ with object; </font><font
  class="font5">so also in the case of anadhyavasaya and samsaya</font><font

  stand the critical investigation of the several alternative explanations of

  cognition of the nature of ascertainment of palm etc.</font><font

  cognition of illusory hair etc.</font><font class="font0"> Thus the object (
  dharmin) cannot be admitted &lt;p.200&gt; as being manifest in doubt. </font><font
  class="font5">Now, on the other hand, if it is said that an attribute
  (dharma) of the object becomes manifest in doubt, then</font><font
  class="font0"> we ask alternative questions : </font><font class="font5">Is
  that attribute of the nature of postness ? Or is it of the nature of manness
  ? Or of the nature of both ? If it is said that the attribute manifested in

  while the other one is unreal; then there would arise the contingency that
  the same knowledge, having real and unreal attributes as its object, would

  nature of doubt, then</font><font class="font0"> we ask as before : </font><font

  Rejoinder : <font class="font5">This opponent who attempts to repudiate the
  very existence of doubt in the manner of Gomayapayasinyaya (viz. by putting
  forth an utterly absurd argument) is ignored even by common people. Indeed
  each creature directly experiences doubt as being of the nature of
  non-determinate cognition. Whether it has a thing as its object, or its
  attribute, whether it is one knowledge or is plural in character, whether it
  has a real object or an unreal object - Can this dialectical disputation do
  any harm however little to the existence of doubt ? If the difference
  apprehended by direct experience is deliberately concealed, then indeed one
  should not recognise the difference between pleasure and pain also,</font><font
  class="font0"> as both are qualities of soul that are produced. </font><font
  class="font5">If it is urged that this is what is desired; then against this
  a question may be asked - On what ground is it so desired ?</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">If the answer to this is</font><font
  class="font0"> that non-difference among things is accepted </font><font
  class="font5">on the basis of the repudiation of all things being established
  (tattvopaplavasiddheḥ)</font><font class="font0">; </font><font class="font5">then
  one may ask in turn as to on what ground tattvopaplava also could be
  established. If the answer to this is that it is established on the ground of
  the absence of the means of valid knowledge</font><font class="font0"> (in
  the absence of pramana no principle could positively be propounded); </font><font
  class="font5">then one may ask on what ground the &lt;p.202&gt; absence of
  the means of valid knowledge could be established. If the answer is that it
  is established on the strength of the absence of definition; and here also if
  any further justification is shown in order to prove the absence of
  definition, then that reason itself would come to be a real entity (tattva).
  So how could tattvopaplava be established ? On the other hand if no
  justification is put forth to establish the absence of definition, then in
  the absence of proof, absence of definition cannot be established. If by mere
  assertion a view could be established then all doctrines would be
  established.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Besides,
  'the absence of definition' itself which is put forth as a ground to prove
  the absence of a means of valid knowledge, also becomes a pramana, as it
  truly proves something. Then how could one establish the absence of all
  pramanas ? And if it is contended - 'We only challenge and repudiate the
  theories of others and we do not seek to establish anything positively'; then
  also there is no justification. For, unless one comes to some positive
  conclusion in respect of the 'other', one cannot justifiably challenge the
  views of others. Moreover, if no pramana is recognised, neither this world
  nor its dealings could be established.</font></td>

  on this in the Nyayabhusana Bhasarvajna says that <font class="font5">Viparyaya
  signifies false ascertainment of an object or a conception of something as
  what it is not; e.g. that cognition of moon is erroneous in which it is
  apprehended as two. One may ask here : Why is one more instance, viz.
  cognition of elephant in a dream, given in the Nyayasara ?</font><font
  class="font0"> That is to say, when one instance, viz. the cognition of two
  moons is sufficient to explain the nature of Viparyaya another illustration
  becomes redundant. The answer to this is that </font><font class="font5">the
  purpose behind giving the second instance is to include all varieties of
  Viparyaya as well as to refute the rival views regarding the classification
  of avidya (no-knowledge). Some seek to establish that cognition in a dream is
  altogether different from the cognition resulting from pramana and from
  memory etc. The second instance is intentionally given in order to
  &lt;p.205&gt; refute this view. Indeed, it is not proper to regard the
  cognition in a dream as different from viparyaya since it is comprehended
  under the definition of Viparyaya. The dream-cognition cannot be a distinct
  variety of avidya</font><font class="font0"> as recognised by the
  Vaisesika-sutra and Prasastapadabhasya. It may not be Viparyaya, but if it
  involves doubt it could be classified as Samsaya. </font><font class="font5">It
  may be urged that in the case of a person who is asleep doubt cannot arise
  since there is absence of the cause of doubt, viz. the common attributes and
  the like (Samanadharmat, etc.). The reply to this is that this is not right,
  for, the word ’Visaya' (object) signifies the Visayin, the knowledge of that
  object and this can be there in a dream. That knowledge of common attributes
  may be either right or wrong. In either case, when it is accompanied by
  auxiliary causes, it is recognised as a cause of doubt. For, the capability
  of a cause can indeed be ascertained by the perception of its effect.</font><font
  class="font0"> That is to say, as we have sometimes in a dream, the cognition
  of the nature of doubt, we must admit that the cause of doubt is present even
  in the dream. </font><font class="font5">Similarly, the dream - cognition in
  which an object that is experienced in the waking state just becomes manifest
  can be called memory. And the dream-cognition which is of the nature of right
  apprehension can be regarded as the result of perception etc; e.g. the
  cognition of pleasure etc. in a dream. That is to say, pleasure, pain etc.</font><font
  class="font0"> are really experienced in a dream, as the mind is active. So
  this experience is of the nature of right apprehension. &lt;p.206&gt; </font><font
  class="font5">Thus like the cognition in the waking state, the
  dream-cognition can be included under doubt, memory etc. in accordance with
  the definition that is applicable to it. The varieties of dream cognition
  correspond to those of the cognition in the waking state.</font><font
  class="font0"> And so in Bhasarvajna's view, </font><font class="font5">dream-cognitions
  are not different from those in the waking state</font><font class="font0">
  so far as classification is concerned. Though dream- cognition may as a whole
  be regarded as a variety of viparyaya, it can be classified as doubt, memory
  etc; as the case may be, like the cognition in the waking state. It need not
  be classified as a distinct variety of avidya.</font></td>

  cognition of man in respect of a post, etc; (ii) due to the close contact
  with another substance, e.g. cognition of 'red' even in respect of white
  cloth; (iii) due to the vicinity of some extraneous condition (Upadhi), e.g.
  cognition of redness in respect of (white) crystal etc; (iv) due to the
  quickness of action, e.g. cognition of simultaneity in respect of actions
  that are in fact successive - the piercing of hundred leaves with a needle;
  (v) due to the motion of a boat etc., e.g. cognition of movement even in
  &lt;p.207&gt; regard to things that are stationary; (vi) due to the power of
  chants, herbs etc. e.g. cognition of magical appearance etc. - these are
  cases of illusion which are primarily due to external causes. The following
  are types of illusion in which internal causes are prominent : (i) The
  cognition of yellowness or the like arises in respect of conch or the like
  due to the visual organ or the like, being overpowered by bile or the like;
  (ii) the cognition of hair-like apparitions arises even in the absence of
  hair due to a defect in the eye viz. timira, partial blindness; and due to a
  similar cause arises the cognition of two moons in respect of one moon; (iii)
  the appearance of a damsel arises due to the intensity of impressions even
  when she is not there; (iv) the perverse conception of what is not a means as
  a means, and of what is not conducive to spiritual uplift as conducive to it,
  arises due to the repetitive study of wrong or misguiding texts; (v)
  erroneous cognition arises in respect of directions etc. due to the efficacy
  of adrsta (unseen force of past deeds). (vi) So also dream-cognition should
  be understood to arise due to the intensity of the residual impressions and
  the like accompanied by sleep.</font><font class="font0"> These are the

  water could not become the basis of such a cognition because it is not

  erroneous cognition of water, for, if they are conceded as being manifested in
  the cognition, there would be the contingency of it not being 'error' at all.
  It is also not proper to say that the rays of the sun are apprehended in the

  no variety in erroneous cognitions. Indeed the proponent of asatkhyati does
  not admit any diversity as present in the object or as present in the

  Hence what are manifested even in erroneous cognitions are diverse objects
  that are established by pramanas. Such an object need not be regarded as
  non-existent, when subjected to a critical examination, since critical
  examination cannot possibly be anything distinct from apprehension. Moreover
  this argument that what is cognised in error is something non-existent is
  contradicted by direct apprehension (pratiti).</font><font class="font0"> The

  (when the nacre is perceived), yet it does exist while it appears. If this
  were not admitted the existence of lightining etc. also could not be proved.
  It appears for a moment, then disappears, but this does not prove its
  non-existence. Therefore, the theory of Prasiddharthakhyati alone is proper.</font></td>

  class="font5">The theory stated above is also not acceptable</font><font
  class="font0"> according to the 'Smrtipramosavadin (Prabhakara Mimamsaka).
  According to him, the notion of memory &quot;I remember silver, and not
  perceive it&quot; is obscured or lost sight of in the erroneous cognition.
  The theory of error known as alaukikarthakhyati is not tenable, </font><font
  class="font5">since alaukika artha, extraordinary thing - cannot be
  established on the ground of any pramana. A thing like water etc. which is

  class="font0"> - there would be no difference between right and wrong
  cognitions. </font><font class="font5">Moreover, it may be asked : On what
  ground could one establish the alaukika, extraordinary thing which is alleged
  to be different from the object established by perception etc. ? The answer
  may be that the thing manifested in erroneous cognition is alaukika only
  because there is no pramana for it. But this is not proper,</font><font
  class="font0"> says the proponent of the theory of error called
  Smṛtipramoṣa-Khyāti. </font><font class="font5">For, in the absence of
  pramana, nothing could be established. Otherwise, things would be established
  everywhere without the basis of pramanas, so what is the need for the
  conception of pramanas ?</font><font class="font0"> The
  alaukikartha-Khyativadin may argue that </font><font class="font5">if the
  point of showing some evidence to establish alaukika or extraordinary thing
  be insisted on, then let a pramana known as 'viparyaya' be conceived to
  establish such a thing,</font><font class="font0"> e.g. nacre-silver etc. </font><font
  class="font5">Further, it is not that this alaukika thing, e.g. silver
  manifested in erroneous cognition, does not possess the characteristic of
  practical efficiency (arthakriyakaitva);</font><font class="font0"> since a
  man runs to pick it up, when he sees it at a distance. </font><font
  class="font5">Though a man cannot reach the moon</font><font class="font0">
  (- of course astronauts have already reached there -), yet he is provoked to
  do some activity by the perception of the moon. So also the nacre-silver has
  practical efficiency, though it cannot be actually obtained. Refuting this
  argl.lment the Prabhakara Mimamsaka &lt;p.213&gt; (who is Smrtipramoṣavadin)
  says that the illusory silver cannot be compared with the moon. If it be
  such, then there would arise the contingency of the cognition of illusory
  silver never being sublated. </font><font class="font5">The cognition of moon
  is never found to be contradicted, but such is not the case with the
  cognition of illusory silver. Moreover, the cognition of a thing that is
  sublated later on by another cognition is never found to be accepted as
  pramana, or as valid proof either in the world (practical life) or in
  Sastras. Besides, we find that in illusory cognition the object appears to
  be, as it is apprehended in perceptual cognition and the like it is not that
  in illusory cognition the object appears as something alaukika -
  extraordinary. Hence this viparyaya,</font><font class="font0"> says the
  Prabhakara Mimamsaka, </font><font class="font5">consists in the obscuration
  of memory</font><font class="font0"> - memory is taken as perceptual
  cognition; and not as memory. In the erroneous cognition. 'This is silver,'
  there are two conceptions, and not one. The conception of 'silver' is in fact
  memory; and as is not of the nature of apprehension, it cannot be accepted as
  pramana (valid); whereas the cognition of 'this' is of the nature of direct
  apprehension and so it is accepted as pramana. Here the conception of
  'silver' which is just in the shape of memory provokes a man to take it up,
  but when he actually reaches, he finds that the thing he saw is not silver.
  Hence the cognition - 'This is silver' is erroneous.</font></td>

  class="font5">signified by the name 'Devadatta' occuring after the

  belongs</font><font class="font0"> would also be Smrti-vipramosa. The
  Prabhakara Mimamsaka argues - </font><font class="font5">Smrti- vipramosa is
  just akhyati (non-knowledge) because the difference between memory and
  experience is not grasped. The cognition that arises later</font><font
  class="font0"> ( i.e. this is not silver) </font><font class="font5">arises
  as distinguishing between these two cognitions having their respective
  objects, it does not sublate anything. But this also is not proper, as it
  goes against our experience.</font><font class="font0"> It is the experience
  of all that erroneous cognition is sublated later when true perceptual
  knowledge in respect of the object arises. </font><font class="font5">Man
  realises that the object &lt;p.216&gt; which was first cognised as silver was
  not really silver, but it was a piece of nacre. Sublation arising in this
  form is experienced</font><font class="font0"> by all. </font><font
  class="font5">But no one realises that silver was remembered and nacre
  ('this') was perceived. Moreover, the cognition 'silver' is experienced as
  having the same object as the cognition 'this' (this is silver); and even
  then if it be regarded as memory, then even the cognition 'nacre' which also
  is experienced as having the same object as the cognition 'this' (This is
  nacre), should be regarded as memory, for there is no difference in the two
  cases. Consequently what is cognised as 'this' could not be specifically signified
  as 'silver' or 'nacre'. Hence it comes to be incapable of being given any
  name ( anupakhya). But this is not justifiable. Moreover, if the memory ( of
  silver) and the presentative cognition (of nacre ) though they both arising
  immediately one after the other without any interval whatsoever, if they
  illumine their own objects viz. silver and nacre respectively, as they really
  are, then how could it be called illusion ?</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">This memory of silver and the perceptual cognition of nacre
  should be true as any other cognition which manifests its own object as it
  really is. If it is urged that in such a case the cognition</font><font
  class="font0"> 'this is silver' in respect of nacre </font><font class="font5">manifests
  the object otherwise, as different from what it is</font><font class="font0">
  - manifests nacre as silver-; </font><font class="font5">then it is a case of
  Viparitakhyati,</font><font class="font0"> and not smrti-Vipramosa. Thus what
  is actually meant by 'Vipramosa' could not be explained by reason and hence
  the theory of Smrti-Vipramosa held by the Prabhakara Mimamsaka cannot be
  accepted.</font></td>

  class="font5">It may be argued that this is the very reason why this is
  called illusion. This signifies that illusion occurs only where there is the
  cognition of something else, when the basis is something different. On the
  other hand, the cognition that manifests the thing which is its basis is true
  knowledge.</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, when the thing before
  us, which becomes the basis of our cognition and the thing manifested in our
  cognition are one and the same, it is true knowledge. So there is nothing
  wrong in saying that in the erroneous cognition of silver and the like, what
  serves as basis (object) is nacre etc and what appears is silver. </font><font
  class="font5">But this does not stand to reason,</font><font class="font0">
  says the proponent of the throry of atmakhyati (Vijnanavadin). </font><font
  class="font5">For besides the object which is manifested in the cognition,
  there is nothing which can be purchased from the sale and could provide a
  basis (alambana, object). Moreover, on the strength of what speciality could
  it be said that the nacre is the alambana of the cognition of silver ? It may
  be argued that nacre is the alambana of the cognition of silver; because</font><font
  class="font0"> of the karmakarakatva. That is to say, </font><font
  class="font5">the nacre becomes the object of the act of cognising</font><font
  class="font0">. </font><font class="font5">But this is not proper, since
  unless the object which is non-different from what is the generator of
  cognition is manifested in the cognition, how could the state of being a
  karmakaraka (karmakarakatva) possibly be known ? If it is argued that such a
  potency of karmakarakatva &lt;p.218&gt; could be established on the basis of
  the nacre being present at that particular place, then this also is not
  tenable. For, if this be admitted, there would arise the contigency of grass,
  etc. existent at that place; also having karmakarakatva. There is not any
  specific reason except the manifestation (of water) why a man is prompted to
  move towards mirage alone, and not towards the grass etc. located at that
  place.</font><font class="font0"> That is to say, cognition is the only means
  through which a man can apprehend an object, whatever it be, real or
  illusory. Hence there is no means of deciding that nacre is the alambana on
  account of being karmakaraka in respect of the knowledge. </font><font
  class="font5">Moreover, one may ask : What could have the karmakarakatva or
  the potency of being the object of cognition manifesting past and future
  things ? No object of the past or of the future could be directly connected
  as object with the present cognition. If it is said that the very object of
  the past or of the future has the potency of being the object of the
  cognition; then it is not tenable. For, such an object does not in fact exist
  there. On the other hand, if some other thing is said to have this potency to
  become the object, then there would arise the contingency of that knowledge
  being erroneous. Consequently there would not be the cognition of the things
  of the past etc. Hence whatever becomes manifest is itself the alambana
  (basis) and the Visaya (object) of that cognition. It is not proper if one
  says, 'I cognise silver', 'this is the cognition of silver,' 'this is the
  cognition of water' or the like; even though the cognition is actually
  characterised by an object which is nacre or the like. Therefore, it should
  be accepted that it is cognition itself that assumes the shape of silver etc.
  Such a shape of silver etc. assumed by the cognition is in fact internal, but
  it appears as if external on account of being overpowered by the
  beginningless avidya (nescience) which upsets things. And people do have such
  impressions (vasanas) which are beginningless and diverse in nature, and
  which fructify in succession. Hence the cognitions having diverse shapes and
  having their own shapes alone as their knowable objects arise in succession.
  Therefore, the theory of error called atmakhyati alone</font><font
  class="font0">, in cognition its own self or shape is cognised, &lt;p.219&gt;
  </font><font class="font5">proves to be acceptable.</font><font class="font0">
  The Vijnanavadin Buddhist believes that even the so-called real objects like
  silver etc. are illusion from the view-point of ultimate reality, this being
  the principal illusion; while when we mistake nacre for silver it is what we
  may call the ephemeral illusion.</font></td>

  class="font0"> That is to say, rajju (rope) cannot be cognised to be the
  object of Sarpajnana (knowledge of serpent). </font><font class="font5">What
  is it then? That which appears or is manifest in a particular cognition is
  said to be its object. And in the cognition of water, what is manifested is
  water alone, and nothing else which is reverse ( i.e. different from it).</font><font
  class="font0"> If something other than water, etc; e. g. rays of the sun etc.
  were manifested in the cognition of water, then </font><font class="font5">there
  would be the contingency of its not being designated as the cognition of
  water;</font><font class="font0"> for things are named as they are known. </font><font
  class="font5">However, that object, water or the like, which appears in an
  illusory cognition is not-existent (sat), for otherwise there would arise the
  contingency of that cognition being non-erroneous (- which it is not).</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Nor is that object, water or the
  like, which appears in the erroneous cognition non-existent (asat), for, in
  that case also there would arise the contingency that such a (non-existent)
  thing like the sky-flower could not become the object of the cognition or of
  &lt;p.221&gt;the activity of moving towards it. Nor also is that object which
  appears in the illusory cognition, existent and non-existent simultaneously
  (sad-asadatmaka) for in that case, both the above-mentioned faults would be
  there and besides this there would be the contradiction in regarding existent
  and non-existent as being of a unitary nature.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">According to the view of Digambara Jaina also all cognitions
  alike manifest an object of the nature of existence and non-existence; and
  consequently there would not be any justification for the classification of
  cognitions as erroneous and non-erroneous. This leads us to conclude that the
  object presented by consciousness cannot be specifically described as
  existent or non-existent or as having any other characteristic. This is the
  very reason why there is no scope for indulging in dialectical discussions
  such as - 'Is avidya (nescience) different from Brahman or non-different from
  it ?'</font><font class="font0"> Indeed, from the view-point of ultimate
  reality avidya cannot be specifically described in any form.</font><font
  class="font5"> If it could have been so described, it would have been a
  reality, and not avidya (nescience). But all recognise that avidya is of the
  nature of non-reality (atattvarupa). Therefore, it is concluded that the
  theory of anirvacaniya-khyati is the only theory that can explain the

  says that <font class="font5">this</font><font class="font0">
  anirvacaniyakhyati </font><font class="font5">also is not tenable.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">For, this view could be acceptable,
  if non-duality could be established. Bhasarvajna refutes the theory of
  &lt;p.222&gt;non-duality later</font><font class="font0"> on in the third
  pariccheda of the Nyayabhusana. There he quotes certain sentences from the
  Upanisads which clearly support the theory of duality. Moreover, if the
  theory of non-duality be accepted, how could it be established ? For,
  pramanas also being based on difference. arc illusory. If such pramanas could
  establish non-duality then they could establish duality also. 'If the
  knowledge of non-duality is said to be different from illusory cognition,
  then the difference is bound to come in. Again, if there is no difference,
  how could one distinguisb pratijiia from hetu ? All this shows that the
  theory of non-duality cannot be maintained. And as said above, unless
  non-duality is established, the theory of anirvacaniyakhyati cannot be
  accepted. </font><font class="font5">Moreover</font><font class="font0">,</font><font
  class="font5"> as to what is said</font><font class="font0"> by the
  Advaitavadin </font><font class="font5">that the object of erroneous
  cognition is not to be known by the instructior or anybody, and so on;</font><font
  class="font0"> Bhasarvajna says that </font><font class="font5">it is the</font><font
  class="font0"> Advaitavadin </font><font class="font5">himself who made that
  object known by his instruction</font><font class="font0"> ( - according to
  his instruction the object of erroneous cognition is anirvacaniya.) </font><font
  class="font5">To wit in the illusory cognition of water or the like, an
  object, water or the like having a definite place and time and nature is
  manifested as existent (sat) only</font><font class="font0"> (and not as
  anirvacaniya), b</font><font class="font5">ecause one who wants to attain it,
  is seen to be active in that direction.</font><font class="font0"> </font><font
  class="font5">Then how could such an object be indescribable (anirvacaniya)?
  Indeed in regard to such an indescribable object, cognition and the activity
  provoked by it could not be possible. It may be argued that on critical
  examination this thing becomes (turns out to be) indescribable as existent,
  non-existent etc; but it does not appear as such at the time of the illusion.
  The answer to this is that in that case since it appears as different from
  what it really is, it is a case of Viparitakhyati</font><font class="font0">
  (and not anirvacaniyakhyati). </font><font class="font5">If it is urged that
  the Viparitakhyati also is not proper, since it is &lt;p.223&gt; contradicted
  by the cognition</font><font class="font0"> (viz. even in the erroneous
  cognition, the thing is manifested as silver, water, etc; and not as reverse
  of something); </font><font class="font5">the answer is that it is not so,
  for, the contradiction is pointed out because the opponent has not caught the
  point. It is not meant to be conveyed that Viparitakhyati signifies the
  knowledge of the form-'This object is reverse' (i. e,) different from what it
  really is). What viparitakhyati signifies is the knowledge viz. 'it is a man'
  in respect of a pillar, which is reverse of a man ( i.e. different in
  character from a man).</font><font class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Again,
  it may be urged that it is not proper to say that a pillar which is not
  manifested in the cognition at all is the object of the cognition which
  manifests a man. And if this be admitted, then there would arise the
  contingency of everything being in disorder - that is, any knowledge could
  have just anything as its object. The answer to this is that it is not so; as
  a matter of fact it is the post that is actually cognised in the cognition
  'This is a man', and not the man. To regard it as knowledge manifesting a man
  is also error, as it actually manifests a post. To wit, after the rise of the
  sublative cognition the person links up his cognition thus : 'This post
  appeared to me as man'. Moreover, the fact that some mistake fake substances
  as genuine can also be explained only by the theory of Viparitakhyati. And
  persons are so much illusioned that they take up such fake substances in the
  hand and tell others : 'I have found or purchased this silver or gold'.
  Therefore, it is proper to conclude that post or the like is determined as
  man or the like in an erroneous cognition due to the non-apprehension
  &lt;p.224&gt; of its real nature and due to demerit etc. </font><font
  class="font0">Therefore, Viparitakhyati is the only theory which can be
  acceptable.</font></td>

  <td class=xl65 width=856 style='border-top:none;border-left:none;width:642pt'>Then,
  Bhasarvajna proceeds to explain the nature of illusion with special reference
  to dream. <font class="font5">It may be asked: What is the Viparita (reverse)
  object in the case of dream-knowledge or the like ? Some say that it is the
  bedstead (khatva) or the like that is there at that place. But it is not so,
  since there is no proof for this. It is not proper to say that a thing
  becomes an object of knowledge only because it is near at hand. In fact, what
  is manifested as object in the dream-cognition or the like is later adjudged
  as such (i.e. as object) even on the strength of the knowledge that serves to
  link up the earlier cognition. And there is no such pratisandhana (linking
  up) in regard to the bedstead or the like. So the bedstead is not the object
  of the dream-cognition. Whatever be the object previously apprehended or not
  apprehended existent or non-existent, that is linked up or recollected by the
  sublating cognition in the waking state, that is the object;</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">- just as when a person links up
  the post as the object of erroneous cognition</font><font class="font0"> (I
  was cognising the post as man),</font><font class="font5"> when the person
  apprehends the post as it really is; that same thing is manifested in the
  dream-cognition as associated with a different place, time or nature and so
  is said to be 'viparita' (reverse). To wit, on waking a person says, 'I saw
  my dead father as living</font><font class="font0"> (- associated with
  different time - Kalanyathatva); </font><font class="font5">I saw my son who
  is in a foreign country as present here</font><font class="font0"> (-
  different place - desanyathatva); </font><font class="font5">a blind man as
  not blind</font><font class="font0"> ( - different nature Svabhavanythatva). </font><font
  class="font5">Even in the case of the illusory cognition of hair-like
  apparitions, the non-existent mass of hair appears as having the form of
  'existent’. For, when it is sublated later, the person realises that the
  non-existent mass of hair was cognised by him as existent. Thus the object of
  erroneous cognition is found recollected in the later knowledge. It may be
  contended that in view of the above examples, Viparyaya or illusion comes to
  be devoid of any object, since a non-existent &lt;p.225&gt; thing cannot properly
  be an alambana (basis) of cognition. The answer to this is that the
  contention is not tenable. For, the things of the past and of the future,
  though being non-existent at present, do serve as alambana. And if there be
  no alambana, it would be a case of akhyati, which is already repudiated.</font><font
  class="font0"> </font><font class="font5">Again, an objection may be raised
  that thus it would not be possible to differentiate illusory cognitions from
  non-illusory ones, because the cognitions of past and future objects and so
  also dream-cognitions have all alike non-existent things as their objects.</font><font
  class="font0"> Yet how is it that we regard dream-cognitions as erroneous,
  and cognitions of past and future objects as non-erroneous ? </font><font
  class="font5">The answer to this is : It is not so; for, it is justifiable to
  distinguish true cognitions from illusory ones, inasmuch as the former grasp
  things as they really are, while the latter grasp things as they are not. It
  is not that right cognition and erroneous cognition are differentiated on the
  basis of their having existent and non-existent things respectively as their
  objects. A thing may be non-existent, but if it is ascertained just as having
  a non-existent shape (i. e. as non-existent) then the knowledge having that
  as its object is certainly true knowledge; for it does not deviate from its
  form. But if a non-existent object is ascertained as existent or as having
  any reverse character</font><font class="font0"> (i.e. character different
  from what it really has), </font><font class="font5">then the knowledge is
  erroneous,</font><font class="font0"> So if (existent) water manifested in
  perceptual cognition is ascertained as it really is, then it is a
  non-erroneous cognition of water; but if non-existent water is ascertained as
  real water, then it is an erroneous cognition.</font></td>

  Bhasarvajna refers to <font class="font5">a view held by some, according to
  which real water, non-real water etc. are diverse phenomenal &lt;p.226&gt;
  forms of water, like sweet water etc. Moreover, according to this view, just
  as in the cognition of real water, illusory water or non-water is not
  manifested, so in the cognition of illusory water, real water or non-water is
  not manifested. Indeed all cognitions result in the manifestation of their
  own objects. Hence, according to this view, there is no cognition in which an
  object could be said to be viparita</font><font class="font0"> (i.e. other
  than what it really is). </font><font class="font5">This view also, says
  Bhasarvajna, stands repudiated by the above arguments adduced in the
  discussion of dreams. As a matter of fact, a thing like non-real water does
  not exist at all. And even if a thing like non-real water is admitted as
  something that is there, and if it is ascertained in the cognition as
  non-real water, then that cognition is certainly non-erroneous, inasmuch as
  it manifests the thing as it really is. But when it ( i.e. non-real water) is
  ascertained as of the form of water, which is capable of being drunk etc; how
  could that cognition be non-erroneous ?</font><font class="font0"> It is
  certainly erroneous, as it manifests a thing as what it really is not. </font><font
  class="font5">And it is well-known everywhere in Sastras as well as in the
  world that a determination in respect of a 'Viparita' (reverse) object is an
  erroneous one. Whosoever proceeds against this well-established fact is
  neither an ordinary man nor a critical investigator, and so he deserves to be
  ignored.</font><font class="font0"> Thus Bhasarvajna refutes all the other
  theories of error, akhyati, asatkhyati etc. and establishes the theory of
  error called Viparitakhyati, which is acceptable to the Nyaya school.</font></td>
