# edit_nbhu_104-154

This is a simple data repo for my Sanskrit editing work on NBhū 104–154. It contains the following files:

* plain-text transcript files of four fundamental witnesses (P1, P2, V, E) plus a similar plain-text version of the critically edited text (CrE)
* a CEX file produced from the above five plain-text files (using [this tool](https://github.com/tylergneill/cte2cex)) and meant for use with Brucheion
* a Classical Text Editor (CTE) file produced from the four fundamental transcript text files (P1, P2, V, E) using CTE's semi-automatic collation function and extensive manual adjustment

Editing conventions for transcript files:
* [delete]
* 〈add〉
* (unclear)
* \* virāma
* ‥ illegible full akṣara
* . illegible part of akṣara
* ¯ space left by scribe
* ² second hand

For witness transcripts, round brackets also enclose folio/page break and line information, e.g., (P1D_023r1). For all, curly brackets enclose passage identifiers, e.g., {104,6;1}.
