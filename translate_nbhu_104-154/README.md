# translate_nbhu_104-154
This is where I keep public copies of my NBhū translation materials.

* zipped LaTeX source files([originals on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vpnjgqqqptww))
* simplified Markdown derived from the above (removing footnotes, extra formatting, etc.)
* also a DOCX file produced from the above Markdown file with below command:

~~~
pandoc -o translation_simple.docx -f markdown -t docx translation_simple.md

See also “align_nbhu_pratyaksa”, in which I align Joshi's English translation to the Sanskrit text.
